vsa. xvh] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 157

God renewed his covenant with the Israelites a little before the
death of Josl1ua3 the Israelites gathered together, besought Reho-
boam that he would remit the rigour of their yoke; and Christ had
a conferenee with the woman of Samaria at Jacob⁷s well. It was
of old a city of refuge, and the metropolis of the Levites.

And laid in tlte sepulchre. As is he had said, They were carried
from the land of Sychem to Hebron, and laid in the burying—place
purchased by Abraham of old for four hundred shekels.

Of the sons ofHamor. These words are not construed with the
verb bouylet, but with the more remote were laid, and so the pre-
position (ff, does not denote the sellers of the burying—place, but
the place itself, from whence the patriarchs were carried forth to
their burial to be laid in the sepulchre which Abraham bought.
The famed De Dieu expounds of tlte sons of Hamor, “ by the help
and assistance of the sons of Hamor, the father of Sychem.”
“Fon” saith he, “ seeing that interment happened when strange

be taken for a place, it is plain that inhabitant is understood ξ if it
be referred to Emmor alone, or if it bc referred to the sons of
