the Israelites after the manner of other kings, and free them from

the yoke of the heathens? Christ had really proposed to restore

the kingdom of Israel, but not the earthly and worldly kingdom,

as both now and at other times the apost-les imagined3 but by re-

calling that people from their incredulity to the knowledge of
himself, that he might rnle in the midst of them by the power

of his gospe13 which St. Paul foretells shall be, Rom. xi. 25, διας

but by reason their minds were clouded with worldly thoughts,

they could not yet understand this mystery. Christ, therefore,

eontenting himself to restrain their curiosity as to the point of

time when it should coine to pass, and which it nothing concerned

them to know, adds to his answer, But you shall receive tlte power of
tlte Holy Glcost upon you. As if he had said, That hcavenly Doctor,

whom I shall send to you, shall instruct yon as to that which now

ye seek from me3 that is to say, what that future restitution of
the kingdom of Israel shall be, which you expect. Though as to

the time, that is a secret which my F ather thinks not proper as

yet to reveal to you, in regard that without that knowledge you

may perform the work committed to your charge. Some are of*
opinion that the kingdom of Israel was then restored by Christ,

when the church of Christ, which is the spiritual Israel, began

to be governed by Christian kings and princcs3 such as were

three hundred years after the birth of Christ, Constantine the

Great, and several other emperors3 but the first interpretation

seems to be the best. For though under those princes, the church

rested from persecution, yet anibition, covetousness, and many

other evils got footing in it, so that the kingdom could not be then

truly said [to be] restored to Israel.

Ιΐ is not your business to know times, &c As if hc had said, It is
not proper nor expedient sor you; according to the common
English version, It is not for you. It is not a thing permitted
for you to know to what point of time the restoration of the king-
dom of Israel is reserved, in regard this is one of those inysterics
which the heavenly Father will have lie hid, and to be at his
disposal to aet as he pleases, otherwise than men look for, and
beyond the reach of human capacity. “It is the eustom of
Christ,'’ saith Grotius, ‘⁶ to refer secret dispensations to the Fathcr,'’
Matt. xx. 233 Mark xiii. 3·. See our litcral expositions upon
those places.
