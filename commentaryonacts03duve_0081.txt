of N oah. For the ark and baptism were both a type and figure of
the resurrection, so that the proper end of baptism ought not to
be understood as if it were a sign of the washing away of sin,
although it be thus oftentimes taken metonymically in the N ew
Testament, and by the fathers, but a particular signal of the resur-
rection, by faith in the resurrection of Christ. Of which, baptism
is a lively and emphatical figure, as also was the ark out of which
Noah returned forth as from the sepulchre to a new life, and
therefore, not unaptly calleci by Philo, ‘the captain of the new
creation.’ And then, the whale’s belly‚ out of which Jonas after a
burial of three days was set at liberty3 and the cloud, and the
Red Sea, in which the people of Israel are said to have been
baptized3 that is, not washed, but buried3 for they were all types
of the same thing as baptism, not of the washing away of sin,
but of the death and resurrection of Christ, and of our own.
To which truth the apostles, the fathers, the scholastics, and all
interpreters agree. The thing is so apparent as not to need any
testimonies: but because there are not a few, who do not vul-
garly teach this doctrine, it will not be superfluous to produce
some of those innumerable testimonies, that I may not seem to
speak without book. And first, let us begin with St. Paul:
Know με not that so many of us as were haptz’zed into Jesus Christ,
were baptz‘zed into his death? T lterzjfbre, we are buried with him by
baptism irato death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by
the Father qulory, so we also should walh in newness of lg'fe, Rom vi.
3, 4. See alsO, Col. ii. 12. Else what shall they do who are
baptizedfor the dead, zf the dead rz'se not at all? 1 Cor. xv. 29. As
if he had said, If there be no resurrection, why are we baptized?
In vain does the church use the symbol of baptism, if there be no
resurrection. The like testimonies frequently occur among the
fathers: ‘ That believing in his death, we may be made partakers
of his resurrection by baptism? ‘Baptism given in memory of
the death of our Lord.'¹ ‘We perform the symbols of his death
and resurrection in baptism.'2 ‘ We know but one saving baptism,
in regard there is but one death for the world, and one resurrection
from the dead, of which baptism is an image.”³ Hear Paul ex-
claiming, They passed throuyh the sea, and were all baptized in the
cloud and in the sea. He calls baptism the passage of the sea, for it
