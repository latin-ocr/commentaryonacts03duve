vna. xxxan] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 65

But the holy martyr Cyprian binds nobody to his opinion con-
cerning those that are sprinkled, or poured upon, in case of sickness
or weakness. “Wherein,’' saith he, “ our moderation doth hindei·
nobody from thinking what he believes, and doing what he thinks.'’
Yea, verily, Cornelius, the Roman bishop and martyr, contem-
porary with Cyprian, in a synod of fifty bishops, questioned
whether sprinkling or pouring upon the sick or weak might be called
a baptism or no: as we may see in his epistle to Fabius, bishop
of Antiochia.¹ Indeed, that the sick as well as the healthy were
wont to be plunged, “which is properly to be baptized,” says
Pamelius in his N otes upon Cyprian’s Epistlc to Magnus, besides
other proofs I omit [in order] to be brief, the acts of several saints
do testify3 as in the acts of St. Sebastian, the martyr, we find
that Tranquillinus, a nobleman, afflicted with the gout, was so
baptized by Polycarp the presbyter, and restored to health by his
baptism. Also a paralytic J ew, who having long tried the physi-
cian’s art in vain, bethought himself of the application of Christian
baptism, and being brought iu his bed to the font or dipping place,
at the appointment of Atticus, who succeeded Chrysostom in the
Constantinopolitan see, was plunged over head and ears, which
being done, he was immediately freed from his distemper, and
restored to perfect health.2 Therefore, if, rejecting the errors of
human contention, we return with a religious and sincere faith to
evangelie authority and apostolic tradition, we shall find it most
safe for them who by necessity, and altogether necessary for them
who lying under no necessity were only sprinkled or poured upon,
to be obedient to Christ, who commanded neither sprinkling nor
effusion, but immersion, and to be plunged into the water ac-

-eording to his institution, who is made to all that obey him the
cause of eternal salvation, Heb. v. 9. Nor is there any reason
why they should be afraid of repeating baptism, or of the scandal
of any church: “because,’' as St. Gregory says most excellently
well‚³ “that is not said to be iterated, which is not certainly
demonstrated to have been rightly and duly done.’' And as he
says in another place, “if there be an offence taken at the truth,
it is much better that offence be taken, than that the truth should
be deserted.” 4 The custonis of ehurches ought to submit to the
words of Christ, not the words of Christ to be wrested to the
