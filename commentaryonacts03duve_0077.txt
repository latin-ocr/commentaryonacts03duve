the Eternal Father. Rabbi Saadias¹ testifies also that the Messiah
is here called Lord by David.

Sit tlzou at my rz'fslzt hand. That is, sit thou and reign in the
heavenly throne, as the apostle explains it. He does not say,
stand before me, but sit ,· which signifies regal and judicia] power.
N either does hc say, sit at my feet, but at my rz‘ylzt hand ; that is,
be thou next in power to me, 1 Cor. xv. 253 Heb. x. 12, 13.

35. Uncil I make, &c. ‘⁶ The word until,’' saith Genebrard, ‘⁶ uses
to be taken emphatically for even until, and signifies continuance,
not [to the] exclusion of future time, to which it is by no means
opposed 3 as if he had said, reign with mc also until Ι have put
thy enemies under thy feet, also, all the time that seems to be
contrary and opposite to thy reign3 also, before I have subdued
thy enemies at thy feet, even before the devil, death, the wicked,
and all sin be utterly extirpated. For it is not to be questioned
but that at all other times Christ shall reign. Observe, therefore,
that by this and the like particles‚ the scripture and the Hebrew
language affirm what might otherwise be called in question, Ps.
cxxiii. 2, Our eyes are fisced upon tlze Lord, until lle shall lzave
compassion upon ηε. That is, even until or before he shows us his
mercy3 that is, in our time of distress. Matt, xxviii. 20, I am witlz
you until tlte end of tlte worlcl‚· that is, even until the end of the
world, before which time, it seems, many things may happen to
fall out contrary to it.’'

36. Asszcredly, &c. That is, let this truth be to you most
certain and undoubted, that this J esus whom you demanded to
the most ignoble and ignominious death of the cross, is appointed
by God the Messiah, promised both in the law and the prophete,
and invested with all power both in heaven and earth.

37. What shall we do ? T hat is, by what means shall we obtain
pardon of so heinous a crime committed by us, when we demanded
this Jesus, constituted Lord of heaven and earth, the Messiah
promised in the law and the prophets, to be put to the scandalous
and ignominious death of the cross.

38. Repent. The Greek, “Be wise agaim„ or “ return to per-
fect understanding.’' As if hc had said, So do you repent of the
fact, that you may not only change your thoughts, but also your
lives for the better, and compose yourselves to live according to
the rule of his divine precepts. “Nothing makes true 1·epentance,'’
