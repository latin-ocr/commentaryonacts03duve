you may see above, ch. ix. 23 3 xiii. 503 xiv. 5 3 xvii. 5, 13; xviii.

Sat. xx, ver. 24.

Who the seditious Gracchi can sustain,
Of others for sedition to complain Ρ

And α mover of sedition. That is, a leader and standard bearer
of the sect that professes the religion of J esus of Nazareth. So
St. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, and a champion for the name of
Christ, in the Afric church in those days, in the proconsular decree
made against him, is called, “ The author and ringleader of that
execrable name.'’

Of tlte sect of the Nazarenes. In the Greek, ‘⁶ Heresy of the
Nazarenes.” That is to say, Those who follow the sect of the
Christians, or embrace their heresy. Heresies are, as Tertullian
defines them, “the doctrines of men and devils, springing from
itching ears.’⁷ Heresy, for the most part, is said to be that judg-
ment and opinion which is chosen by any, whether it be invented
by us or received from another. Yet use has prevailed now,
especially among Christians, that this word, that before was used
either in a good or bad sense, is, for the most part, now used in a
bad, to wit, for the choosing of a false and perverse opinion plainly
and altogether repugnant to the word of G0d3 see above, ch. v. 17 3
Gal. v. 203 and 2 Pet. ii. 10. The Jews therefore abhorred the
doctrine of the Christiane, though it was agreeable to the law and
the prophetS, as heretical and perverse, because it dissented from
the common faith of the public church, which at that time was
accounted the church of God. So also, at this very day, they
who follow the appointments of Christ are called heretics if they
vilify and reject the errors of formal Christians that are crept into
the church by custom. Moreover, as the learned Lud. de Dieu
very pertinently observes, ‘⁶ That Christ was called Ναξαραῖος, or
Ναζαρηνὸς, and his followers Ναξαραῖοι, did not proceed from a
mistake of the common people, asffsupposing him born at Nazareth3
nor from the mockery of the wicked, as accounting it a reproach
to him, but from God’s own purpose and will, and the use of the
godly themselves. The purpose of God is manifest, Matt. ii. 23.
where Joseph, returning from Egypt with the child Jesus, is
commanded to fix the seat of his habitation at Nazareth, that,
according to the predictions of the prophets, he might be called a
Nazarene. And that the godly delighted in the use of this
name plainly appears from John i. 45 ; Acts ii. 22 3 iii. 6 3 iv. 10.
