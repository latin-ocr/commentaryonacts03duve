VER. xL111.] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 179

18. WVhence also the god of the Ammonites, who is commonly
called Moloch, is called Baal, J er. xix, 5, and elsewhere3 neither
will ye almost find the name Moloch used peculiarly for the god
of the Ammonites in the scripture, but where the naming or men-
tioning of the Ammonites either goes before, or immediately
follows 3 wherefore it is called Melcom or Milcom, with a pronoun
relative to the Ammonites. Yet Theodoret, on Ps. cv. hath
observed, that Baal or Bel is in a special manner attributed
to Saturn. Suidas, on Beelphegor, saith, “Beel is Saturn, but
Phegor is the place where he was worshipped, whence he is
called Beelphegor.” Servius, on AEneid. 1, saith, ‘⁶ In the Car·
thaginian tongue, Baal signifies G0d; but by the Assyrians,
Bel, by a certain use peculiar to sacred things, is called both
Saturn and Sol.” Also with the most learned, Moloch is the same
with Saturn, especially in these words of Amos, cited here by
Stephen, where the same is called in the Hebrew original 3³⁵2,
and in the Seventy interpreters ῥαιφὰυ. He upbraids them there-
fore, because they carried about with them the tent and image of
the star Saturn, which they wrought for themselves, that they might
worship them as types and figures of their God, when yet the true
God will not be worshipped by a visible or external shape. See
our literal explication, Amos v. 26, on which place Grotius
speaketh thus: ‘⁶ As Moloch is an Ammonitish name, so Kiun is
an Arabic or Persian, which Abenezra saith is also written Kivan,
and that it is with them the same as Saturn. The same is called by
the Syrians Remmon, 2 Kings v, 18, to wit, because it was in the
highest orb, as Tacitus speaketh. As Kiun was also pronounced
Kivan, so Remmon was also Remvan3 which the Greeks, having
lost the use of the letter F, wrote ῥαμφὰν or ῥεμφὰν, which is
their true writing. But Moloch, Kiun, or Kivan, are called gods,
’ because although they were referred to the same star, yet they had
divers names, habit, and worship, as the Moon and Diana with the
Greeks. Many men also were related to the same star among
different nations: and Moloch was of the shape of a king, Kivan
of a star.''

Beyond Babylon. In the Hebrew, Amos v. 27, And I will remove
you beyond Damascus. See our literal explication there. The most
renowned Samuel Petit, renders the place of Amos otherwise: “And
