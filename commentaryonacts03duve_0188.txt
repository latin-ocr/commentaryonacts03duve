And now I am come, &c. As if he had said, Go therefore to
Amenophis, father to Sethosis‚ or Ramesis, and Armais, and son to
Ramessis Miamun, who succeeded his father, who died in 1110
sixty-seventh year of his reign, in the kingdom of Egypt, nine-
teen years ago, and show thyself a leader in restoring thy people
to their liberty. That the same man whom the Egyptians called
Amenophis, father to Sethosis, or Ramessis, and Armais, was by
1110 Greeks called 1301115, 1110 father of Egyptus and Danaus,
Bishop Usher hath most clearly collected out of Manetho‚ on the
year of the world 1494: “ And truly the time assigned to Belus
by Thallus the chronographer, 322 years before the destruction of
Troy, according to the relation of Theophilus of Antiochia and
Lactantius, does exaetly jump with the age of our Amenophis.

Belus the Assyrian, N inus’s father, do fable that this Belus, who

and strange miracles wrought by him in Egypt, when at last the
first-born of 1110 Egyptians were slain by the destroying angel, he
preserved the people of God by the blood of the Lamb and
brought them safe out. ‘⁶ And so,” saith Lud. de Dieu “he gave
a type of that true price and that true redemption, which believers
rejoice to have been purchased for them, by the death of 1110
First-begotten of all the creation, and by the blood of Christ the
immaculate Lamb.'’
