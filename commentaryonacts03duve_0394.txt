14. And then immediately, &c. As much as to say, But the
Christiane at Bcraea, that Paul might be delivered from the suares
of the unbelieving Thessalonian «Jews, took care to convey him to
the sea-coast, and entered into a ship as if he were to sail from
these regions, while Timothy and Silas abode at Beraea, that they
might confirm in the faith these who were newly converted. But
what Luke did, or where he was at that time, since he himself is
silent, is rash to conjecture.

To 90 as it were to the sea. The Syrian, Arabio, and Ethiopic‚
render it simply “to the sea,” either ὡς or ἐπὶ being put by a

that Paul should have passed by so many regions, as are betwixt
Thessalonica and Athens, to wit, Thessaly, Baeotia and Attica,
having nowhere preached the gospel, or that Luke, who was Paul's
companion as appears above, ch. xvi. lO, should have omitted that
history of what was said and done there.

Beraea, that with all speed they would come to him, they departed
from Athens to return to Beraea. Athenae Attieae is a famous city
