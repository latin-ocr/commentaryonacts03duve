and Taam3 and Edem, one son of Shuthelah, Ephraim’s grandson.
But instead of Taam, Augustine, Civ. Dei, lib. xvi„ cap. 40, has
Bareth, from 1 Chron. vii„ in which chapter it is also to be
observed, that there is neither mention made of Taam nor Edem,
and that the sons of Manasses, Machir, and Ephraim, were
reckoned more than five. WVherefore did they then pitch upon
only five of them to put into Moses' catalogue? Because they
who would supply Stephen's number in h‘Ioses did not stand in
need of more. But the same persons, not very consistent with
themselves, ver. 27, added to Manasses and Ephraim, with their
five sons and grandsons, two others, although without their names.
For instead of that which is in Moses, ‘ And the sons of Joseph
who were born in Egypt were two souls,' the Seventy have ‘ nine
souls ς’ whence at last was the number of the fifty-seven souls to
be collected3 so that all things in that verse are most corrupt, and
worthy of no credit. Nor can any greater absurdity be imputed
to Stephen, than that Joseph sent for not only himself, and his
two sons present with him, but also his three grandsons, and two
of their sons, who were born long after.''

the bones of the patriarchs, who went down with Jacob into
Egypt, were first indeed transported to Sychem, but thence to
Hebron, and interred in the sepulchre which Abraham, Gen. xxiii.
16, bought from the sons of Ephron. And thus at Sychem indeed
were the empty monuments, as Hieronymus an eye-witness testi-
fies in the epitaph of Paula, but in Hebron were the true sepul⁴¹
chres of the patriarohs, of which Josephus saith, Antiq„ lib. ii.‚
cap. 4, “But his brethren died after they had lived happily in
Egypt, whose bodies, after some time, their posterity and children
buried at Hebron. But they transported the bones of Joseph
afterwards, when the Hebrews departed out of Egypt into
Canaan.” W hence it may be concluded that the bodies of the
eleven patriarchs were buried at Hebron, and that before their
departure out of Egypt : but that J oseph’s bones were transported
into Canaan long after, at. their departure. For although he does
