at Jerusalem was to be understood. Here, therefore, [we have]
the bcst interpreter that could be wished of that constitution, from
whom we may learn, how far the prohibition of things offered to
idols does extend, and what force it has to bind the consciences of
faithful Christians. For there being divers kinds of idolotlzytes,
the question cannot be solved but by using a distinction. Some
idolotlzytes there are from which we are to abstain only for fear of,
or to avoid the scandal that may thence happen to arise3 such are
those which are commonly sold in the market, or which are set
before us in the private treats of our friends. But there are
other idolotlzytes from which we must abstain, because it is simply
and in itself evil to eat thereof 3 as those which are eaten in an
idol temple, which is always done with some either open or tacit
approbation of idolatry. To this of the latter kind, as being of
greater moment, the apostles, no doubt, in their famous council, had
chiefly an eye. Yet sometimes it may happen, that to eat of those
idolothytas which are set to sale in the market, may not be without
danger, as we are taught in the history of Julian the Apostate, who
out of his restless desire to propagate the Pagan religion, or rather
to vex the Christiane, caused all thev meat in the shambles to be
polluted with sacrifices offered to his gods, that so the Christians
might be forced to feed on idolothytes‚ unless they would starve3
of which very thing we read in Theodoret thusz' ‘He (that is,
Julian) first defiled all the fountains‚ that were either in the city
of Antioch or at Daphne (most famous suburbs of the same city)
with wicked consecratione, so that whoever drank the water
thereos should likewise be infected> with the stains of idolatry.
And at last, whatever was exposed to sale in the market he
polluted in like manner. F or all the bread, flesh, fruits, herbs,
and other eatables, he caused to be sprinkled with holy wat-er,
which when the Christians saw, though they could not but grieve,
lament, and heartily detest those abominations, yet they refused
not to eat thereos, in obedience to that rule of the apostle, What-
ever is sold in the shambles, that eat, askiny no question for conscience
sake, l Cor. x. 25. Otherwise, it is well known how much eating
of idol-sacrifices was commonly abhorred amongst Christians3
insomuch that our Lord J esus layeth Jezebel’s charge, Rev. ii. 20,
as a most heinous wickedness, that she had seduced his servants to
commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And
Leo the Great decreed :2 “ That whether fear or hunger prevailed
