And you required a murderer to be mantal unco you. That is,

15. Batyou killed the Author of lffe. That is, by your urgent
instigation‚ you compelled Pilate to condemn the Prince of Life to
death. The Greek word, as Erasmus observes, consists of words
contrary to themselves, being compounded of one word signifying
beginning, and another word derived from the end, as much as
to say, beginner and ender: therefore Christ is said to be the
Beginner and Ender of eternal life. For as the learned John
Davenant, bishop of Salisbury‚ observes upon Col. iii. 4, “He
promised us this life, he merited it, he prepared it, he will grant

α crown ofjastice, which the Lord will yive me, 2 Tim. iv. 8. Christ
is therefore truly called our Life, that is the Author or Cause of
our life eternal. And being] consecrated, he is mode the Author of
eternal Zffe to all that obey him, Heb. v. 9.''
