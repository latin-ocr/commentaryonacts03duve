And the resurrection of the dead. Whom that they should be
raised again to life the old Sadducees also denied.

Am called in question. That is, called to judgment·

7. There arose a dissension between tlte Pharisees and the Sad-
ducees. While those approved of Paul’s opinion, that there should
be a resurrection of the dead 3 and these condemned it.

And the multitude was divided. Both the senators and the
standers-by, while some took part with the Pharisees, others with
Sadducees.

8. The sadduceos, &c. As if he had said, But the Pharisees
and the Sadducees were at great variance and discord among
themselves; for whereas the Sadducees denied the resurrection of
the dead, and stiffly avouehed that there was no angel and spiritual
or incorporeal substance3 but that those things that went under
the denomination of angel or spirit, were nothing else, but either
the motions which God implanted in men, or the demonstratione
he exhibited cf his power3 the Pharisees, on the contrary, stoutly
maintained the resurrection of the dead, and the existence of angele
and spirits, or substances distinct or separate from matter.

Nor spirit. Some restrict this to the spirit of man, or the soul ;
which also elsewhere is called “a spirit,” as you may see above,
ch. vii. 593 Matt. xxvii. 503 Luke xxiii. 46 ς Heb. xii. 23. “ This,”
say they, “the Sadducees conjecture not to be any spiritual sub-
stance, which could subsist separate from the body, but only to be
a certain erasis and temperament of the body and its humours, and
therefore that when a man dies it is destroyed, vanishes, and dies
with the body.'’ Others by spirit here understand, the Holy
spirit, as John iii. 53 iv. 243 Rom. i. 4¹3 viii. 14—16; lCor.
iii. 4. Epiphanius truly writeth thus of the Sadducees: “But
they are ignorant of the Holy Spirit, for they are unworthy of him.’'
And Theophylact, reciting these words of the verse immediately ,
following: But 2] α spirit or an anyel laath spoken to him, saith, ‘⁶ It
is manifest- that he was taught the resurrection either by the Holy
Spirit or by an angel? Joseph Scaliger declares, that as angel
in this verse is put indefinitely for all angeIS, so spirit is to be
taken indefinitely: for angel is the species, spirit the genus3 for-
asmuch as angels are comprehended under it. ‘⁶ St. Luke's mean-
ing,” saith the most learned Scul'tetus, according to Scaliger, “will
be, ‘They are so far from believing the existence of an angel, that
they do not indeed believe there is any spirit.' This opinion,
