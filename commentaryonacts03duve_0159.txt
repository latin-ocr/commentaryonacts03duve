VER. IL] LITERALLY EXPLAINED, 139

a city of Babylonia, according to Eusebius3¹ but according to
Ptolemy, situate near Euphrates, in Babylonia 3 or the city Orchoa,
or any other city of Chaldaea, whose name was changed. But the
Chasedim, Chaldaeans, who were the issue of Chesed the son of
Nahor, Gen. xxii. 22, seem to be mentioned by a prolepsis, Gen.
xi. 31, as are the names of Bethel, Dan, &c.” Thus far the ntoft
renowned Frederick Spanheim, the son, in his introduction to
Sacred Geography. The most learned Usher, bishop of Armagh,
is of opinion that the word Chasedim is rather an appellative of a
sect, denoting diviners and magicians, than the proper name of a
nation. The fortune-tellers in Chaldaea itselfi arc also found dis-
tinguished by that name, Dan. ii. 2, 103 iv. 7 3 v. 11. “ Stephen,”
saith Heideggcr, “reckons Mesopotamia the same with Chaldaea.
For this reason certainly, that that part of Mesopotamia which lies
next to Syria, is in the scriptures also mentioned under the name
of Chaldaea. And Pliny, lib, vi. 26, declareth that some part of
Babylonia, yea, Babylon itself, was comprehcnded within the
bounds of lVIesopotamiaff’ Babylon, the head of the Chaldaio nations,
for a long time enjoyed the greatest renown in the whole world;
on which account the rest of Mesopotamia and Assyria was called
Babylonia. And the same Pliny a little after: “There are also
cities in BIesopotamia, Hipparenum, and this of the Chaldees, as
also Babylon near the river Narraga, which gave name to a city.”
The Persians demolishcd the walls of Hipparenum. The Orchcns,
also a third sect of the Chald-acaus, were placed in the same situ-
ation, turned toward the south. “Moreove1·‚ Tremellius is of
opinion that Orchoe is thc same with Ur. The same Pliny² also
declareth, that lVIesopotamia is bounded on the east with Tigris,
on the west with Euphrates, on the south with the Persian Sea,
and on the north with the mountains of Taurus3 50 that not only
all encompassed by the two rivers, but also all places situate by
their bank-s, are to be comprehended in Mesopotamia„ Possibly
the words of Josephus³ tend also to the same purpose, where,
speaking of Abraham, he saith, ‘When the Chaldaeans and the rest
of the Mesopotamians rose up against him, he determined to
transmigrate himself, and relying upon the good will and favour of
God, he went and dwelt in the land of Canaan.’ Itis therefore
apparent, that Abraham's native country Ur, may rightly be as—
cribedboth to Mesopotamia and also to Chaldaea.” Thus far
