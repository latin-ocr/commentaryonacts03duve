every man holds his faith there, without which he cannot live godly and
righteously3 there are so many things wrapt up in such multiplicity of veils,
that are to be understood by proficients, and there is such depth of wisdom
couched, not only in the words whereby these things are expressed, but also in
the things that are to be understood, that it fares with the most aged, the most
acute, and those who are most desirous of learning, as the same Scripture has
in a certain place, “ When a man has done, then he beginneth.'’

Tlee same Auyustine in tlte same place, Numb. 18.

The manner of speaking, whereby the holy Scripture is connected, how acces-
sible is it to all, though it be penetrable by very few ! , Those things which it
’ contains that are manifest, it speaks as a familiar friend without sophistication
to the hearts of the unlearned and learned. And those things that it hides
in mysteries, it does not raise thern up beyond our capacities by lostiness of
style, so as a dull and illiterate mind dare not approach, as one that is poor to
a rich person; but it invites all by its low style, whom it may not only fecd by
manifest truth, but also exercise with hidden, having the same things in what
is manifest as in what is hid. But that the things being plain might not be
loathed, the same things being again hidden are desired, being desired, they
are in some manner renewed, being renewed they are delightfully received.
By these both depraved minds are wholesomely amended, the mean are
nourished, and the great delighted. He only is an enemy to this learning who,
either by reason of his mistakes, is ignorant of its soundness, or by reason of
his distemper has an aversation to medicine.

 

The Golden Sccyiuy of St. Prosper.

Reader, though in the sacred books thou long'st to know,
Many things are concealed and hid thee fro 3

Yet watch, and still pursue thy good intent,

Gifts that are stay'd for move thy mind, if bent 3

That fruit's more grate which hope drawn out brings forth,
Things easily attain’d are nothing worth,

Even hidden mysteries solaco the mind ;

Who gave to ask, will further give to find.
