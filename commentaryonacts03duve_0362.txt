twenty days3 he that is poor or dull, and shall eat anything
( raudatum) stolen or unjustly come by, let him do four days’
penance: but for those that do these things knowingly, be they
sick or well, let them do penance forty days3 those that do it
often, let them do forty days or a years’ penance3 which place of
Bede Salmasius in his book, De Foenore Trapezitico, amends, and for
fraudatum, ‘ stolen,’ reads szqffocatmm ‘ strangled,' or afratum, which
is a kind of pudding: yet in the Penitential of Theodorus we find
a passage agreeable to that first text of Bede‚1 ⁶ If any one shall
knowingly eat anything stolen, or plundered‚ or unjustly come by,
if he be poor let him do penance seven days3 if rich forty.”’
Clearer yet to our purpose is that which the same Regino, lib. i.
cap. 300, has out of the Penitential of Theodorus or Bede: ‘⁶ Hast
thou eaten of anything that died of itself or worried by beasts‘?
do penance forty days, the like if thou hast eaten blood.” So
Zachary, Bishop of Rome, in his twelfth Epistle to Boniface,
Archbishop of lN'Ientz, forbids those beasts to be eaten which were
either strangled or taken by other beasts. The Synod of VVorms
under Ludovicus Pius, cap. 64: “if an animal be wounded, and
tasted by wild beasts, and a man finds it before it be dead and kill
it, he may lawfully eat thereof3 but if it be dead first, let its fiesh
be thrown away.'' And ch. 65 : “ Animals which are worried by
wolves and dogS, are not to be eaten by any but dogs and hogs.
Nor is a deer 01· goat if found dead: but of fish you may eat,
because they are of another nature; but birds and other creatures
if they are strangled in nets are not to be eaten.” Rabanus
Maurus, Archbishop of Mentz, upon Levitious, lib. v. cap. 8 ε “ It
is therefore necessary to keep this commandment literally, and in
nowise to eat b100d3 for thou wilt find that the same thing is also
commanded by the apostles.'' Most remarkable is that ordinance
of the Emperor Leo the Sixth of that name, surnamed the Philo-
sopher, B.C. 886, Cons. 58: ‘⁶ Althougb God both of old by Moses
the law-giver commanded that blood should not be eaten, and by
the preachers of grace declared that men ought to abstain from
such food3 and although the eating thereos as well under the New
Testament as the Old, hath ever been condemned as an infamous
and unlawful thing, yet to that degree of obstinaoy or rather mad·-
ness are men grown, that they refuse to yield obedience to either
law, but on the contrary some for gain, and some for gluttony, do
with the highest impudence contemn the command, and turn
