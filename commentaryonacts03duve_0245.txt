they should not depart from that custom in any thing, by a human
and new institution, the which custom Christ did keep and com-
mend. We may see the words of Julius in Gratian.¹ God grant
that in like manner all that are called Christians, and either
ignorantly, or simply by a human and new institution, have
changed baptism (or retained the change of baptism), dipping, that
is, appointed by Christ, into rhantism, that is, sprinkling, against
the apostolical and evangelical discipline observed by our ancestors‚

the eunuch did receive that extraordinary gift of the Holy Spirit,
which Cornelius, with his household, received also before baptism 3
