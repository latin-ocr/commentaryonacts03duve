A friend z's born in a day of adversz'ty5 that is, he then discovers
himself, when our straights press us. For, although the Father,
also, before the resurrection, gave testimony to him, yet because
until his resurrection Christ was as it were encompassed with
infirmitieS, and liable to death, his calling to the mediatory office
was somewhat obscure until that day. But when, having laid
aside his mortality, he gloriously rose again and ascended into
heaven, then did he properly, as it were, openly declare unto all,
that Christ is both his Son, and called to the priestly office. But
God, until that very day, as 116 saw becoming his own wisdom,
delayed to make this mystery known. Hence it is that Paul saith
in this place, that God at last, after Christ's resurrection, said to
him, T hou art my son, this day leave I hefsotten thee)⁹ Justin, in his
Colloquy with Trypho z “ Saying he was born from thence, whereof
it was to come to pass he should be born-'⁹ From this place of

the same, in both are understood the free promises of God made to
David. “For which,’⁷ saith Ludovicus de Dieu, “he will not
wonder that the Hellenists called them τὰ ὅσια, ‘holies,' who
knows when they would call God ἾὍΓΣ, ‘ bountiful,' they call him
‘ holy,’ Ps. xvii. 28, and render the Hebrew word 7911, indifferently
‘mercy’ and ‘ righteousness ς’ and lest any should think that they
mean any other thing by ‘1·ighteousness,’ than they do by ‘mercy,'
they frequently render Πρζῐὶξ, which properly denotes ‘righteous-
