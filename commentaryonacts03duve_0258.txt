αὐτὸν, that is, as Lud. de Dieu interprets it, “that he may thus
convince him by his reasons, as to knit him, and, as it were, glue
him to himself.”

23. And after that many days were fuffilled. By those many
days are, to be understood the three years which Paul spent in
Arabia, whither, as we observed above, ver. 19, out of Gal. i. 17,
he was gone soon after his conversion, although Luke, who was not
with him, does not make mention of this journey. ‘⁶ Paul,” saith
Capellus, Gal. i. 17, “denies that he came to Jerusalem to the
apostles, immediately after his conversion, but affirms that he went
straight from Damascus to Arabia, and from thence returned to Da-
mascus. Lastly, that after three years he came to Jerusalem. These
three years must be begun nowhere but at Paul’s conversion, that
by this Paul might testify that he came not to Jerusalem, until the
end of three years after his conversion, to them which were apostles
before him. This being granted, it must needs be that Paul spent
not those three years in Damascus, but in Arabia. For if a great
partos them was spent at Damascus, seeing that Damascus was
distant from Jerusalem but a very few days' journey, and that
there was great commerce betwixt the Damascenes and the Jews
at. Jerusalem, how could it be, when Paul came from Damascus to
Jerusalem, that all the believers did avoid him, not knowing that
he was converted to the saith of Christ? Hence, then, it seems a
strong argument may be drawn, that Paul, immediately after his
conversion, went from Damascus to Arabia, and that he spent those
three years there, after which time, when he came to Damascus,
and immediately had snares laid for him by the Jews, that being
let down in the night-time by the wall in a basket, he came to
J erusalem3 and that at first the faithful fied from him, because
he spent all the time since his conversion in Arabia, among that
people who had little or no commerce with those of Jerusalem. So
that thus they might be ignorant of his conversion, which could
not so easily be, if Paul had spent those three years, or the most
part of them, at Damaseus.’⁷
