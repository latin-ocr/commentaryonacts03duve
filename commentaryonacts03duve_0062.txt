42 THE AC'rs OF THE HOLY APos'rLEs [CHAP. ΙΙ.

With the country named AEolis, extending itself on the one side to
the Adramitic Gulf, on the other side to the fountains of the river
Meander.” Of this province, which was more strictly called
Asia, the metropolis was Ephesus, the seat of the proconsuls of
Asia. The next to Ephesus, in the time of the apostleS, was
Smyrna3 the same city being also a metropolis: after that, Per-
gamus, the seat Of the famous king Attalus, as the most learned
Spanheim relates in his Introduction to Geography.

10. Plzryyia. In the Asian diocese which was subject to the
Asiatic vicar. There was a two-feld Phrygia, of which the one
was called the greater and Pacatian, the other the lesser and the
healthful. The first was bounded to the north by Bithynia and
Galatia3 to the east, by the healthful Phrygia and Pisidia3 to the
south, by Lydia, Caria, and Lycia3 to the west, by the proconsular
Asia. The metropolis of this country was Laodicea, upon the
river Lycus. Phrygia the wholesome was conterminous northward
to the greater, toward Galatia and Bithynia. The metropolis of

ancient coins, according to the relation of the fore-cited Spanhemius.

diocese to the south, toward the sea-shore, from thence called the
Pamphilian Sea. It is bounded to the east by Cilicia and part of
Cappadocia3 to the west, by Lycia3 to the north, by Galatia.

it was under one and the same governor with Lycia, in the reign
of Constantine the Great3 but at length made consular under
Theodosius the younger, and divided into two parts3 the first part
whose metropolis was Sida, and the second whose chief city was
Perga.” Moreover, although that in Pamphilia and the rest of
the provinces already mentioned the Greek language was fre—
quently used, yet there was another dialect proper to every
country, and differing from that of the adjoining provinces There-
fore Strabo affirms that the Cibyrates made use of four dialects,
the Pisidie, Grecian, Lydean, and Solyman. The Syrians also
spake two languages at that time, as also the JeWS, for they used
both the Greek and Syriae. Nay, they might be said to make use
of three languages, in regard the Latin was also spoken among
them, as the learned Salmasius observes.
