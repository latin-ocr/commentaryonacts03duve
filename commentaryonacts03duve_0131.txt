figuure called metonymia adjunctis So also Grotius: “ He is
said,’' saith 110, “to lie to God, or the Holy Ghost, who hopes that
110 ean deceive the apostles who are instrueted by 1110 Holy Ghost.”

And to keep back part of the price of the land. That is to say,
Laying but a part of the price of the possession sold by you at the
apostles’ feet, you would in the mean time dissemble you laid the
whole, thinking your hypocrisy could be hid, and that the apostles,
though filled with the Holy Ghost in the day of Pentecost, could
in nowise discover the cheat. Ἴ

4. While it remained, &c. As much as to say, Was it not in
thy power either not to have sold thy possession, or, having sold it,
to keep the whole price, or a part of it, 1ο thyself? what then did
drive you 011 thus to obey the devil's persuasions, that having
secretly withdrawn part of it, and laying it aside, and laying
another part at the apostles' feet, that you by hypocrisy and
lying, should dissemble, that you brought the whole, and laid it at
the apostles' feet? Do not [think that we who are men, are only
mocked with thy deceitful hypocrisy‚ seeing this mocking tends
to the reproach of the Holy (3111001, even as much as if thou hadst
intended by thy deecit to moek the Holy Ghost‚ who is God,
sceing wc by 1110 inspiration of the Holy Ghost discover the secrcts
of the hcarts. Likewise Paul, after he had said, what precepts he
gave to the Thessalonians by the Lord Jesus, and upon what

who gave us the Holy Ghost, by whom wc are governed, and by
whose influence 11- 10 evident that we speak. “Men then arc
opposed to the Holy Ghost3 they are also opposed to God3
therefore the Holy Ghost is God, ver. 4. For he to whom
Ananias chiefly lied, or whom 110 chiefly endeavoured to deceive,
the same is God3 but 1110 Holy Ghost is he whom Ananias chiefly
endeavoured to deceive, or 10 whom he lied3 it follows 111011 that
the Holy Ghost is God,’⁷ saith learned Christopher vWittichius, in
his learned Book called Causa Spiritus Sancti.

Thou hast not lied meto men, but unto God. That is to say, thou
hast not endeavoured to deceive men only, but, above all, the Holy
Ghost, who is God, and who reveals to us things secret. See
such expressions in Exod. xvi. 83 1 Sam. viii. 73 Luke x. 163
1 Thess. iv. 8.
