barbariam saw the venomoccs beast hans] on ltz's hand. Others again,
choose rather to say, ‘did bite or sting,’ as if it should be read,
καθήψατο. For καθάπτεσὲαί τινος, in the passive conjugation is
‘to bitc,’ yet not with teeth, hut with cavils and scoffing taunts.
And indeed Chrysostom, on this place, for καθῆψε, reads καθήψατο.
Which, notwithstanding, he takes in another sense, to wit, for
simplo ἥψατο, that is, ‘assaulted, set upon.⁷ For he expresseth
himself to this purpose in the subsequent exposition: ‘A viper
coming out of the fire, set on his hand: what follows makes it
manifest that he was assa-iled.⁷ By all means, Chrysostom must
be so rendered. In regard that ammeca ἀνθρώπου, is ‘to assail a
man,’ as Stephanus makes out of Plato, Thucydides, and Plutarch.
VVhence it is that a great many render καθῆψε τῆς χειρὸς, ‘assailed
his hand,’ as if καθῆψε or καθήψατο were not distinct from ἥψατο.
But there is no need to change anyssring, nor to add strange
unusual notions to the common word, since it is most pertinent to
say that the viper fastened on Paul’s hand. For a serpent is said
to tie whatever is compassed with her windings. Hence the
prince of poets :—

Two serpents fierce Laocoon assail’d,

And bound him fast by windings that prevail’d.
Nicander likewise, in his Theriacs, or Antidotes against Poison‚
ver. 47 5, advises to take care that the little spotted serpent burn
thee not, tying fast thy body by the strokes of her tail. Leo
Byzantius, also, in Boeoticis, by the testimony of Plutarch, in his
book of Rivers, speaking concerning the boy Cythaeron, insinuates
that he was killed by a serpent that tied him with her windings.
And Cicero, of Roscius, in his first book on Divination: ‘The
nurse in the night being awakened by the light that was brought,
saw a serpent winded close about the child? Again, in his second
book: ‘It may be an untruth that Roscius himself was tied fast
by the windings of a serpent.’ This is further confirmed by AElian,
in the sixth book, cap, 21, of his History, where he asserts that the
dragon that set upon an elephant, ‘having crept up to his neck, and
striking him with one part of his tail, and binding him fast. with
the other, strangled the beast with an unusual halter.' Macrobius,
in the Description of Hercules's Knot, Sat. lib. i., cap. 19:
‘Those dragous tie one another towards the middle by a knurle

called Hercules's knot.⁷ ’'
