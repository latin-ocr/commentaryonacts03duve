from the yoke of the Philistines. For in aftertimes Saul was by
the Philistines stripped of his authority, and the people of Israel
oppressed by them with a heavy and long bondage3 which being
at length removed, Saul is said to have taken the kingdom over
Israel, that is, to have again recovered it, 1 Sam. xiv. 47. It is a
proof that this oppression lasted many years, that it having begun
eight years before David was born, yet before it was ended,
Samuel named him to succeed in the kingdom of Saul, 1 Sam.
xiii. 14: lee Lord laath souyht him a, man after lais own beart, and
the Lord lzatlz commanded him to be a captain over lais people. For
that the Israelites might be past all hopes of recovering their
liberty, lest they might have weapons the Philistines carried
away all the smiths from them3 so that when the Israelites came
to battle, among all them Saul and Jonathan only were found
armed with sword and spear, 1 Sam. xiii. 19, 223³ Daniel Brenius,
in his friendly debate against the J eWS, Quaest. 26 : “ How,” saith
116, “is that consistent, which is written, Acts xiii. 21, that Saul,
who was the first king of Israel, reigned forty years when the
scripture mentions only two years? Answer. These two years
mentioned, 1 Sam. xiii. 1, may be so taken, as not to note the
whole sum of Saul’s administration‚ but that time of his govern-
ment, until he chose these three thousand, which are mentioned
there, ver. 2, otherwise if we will take it absolutely that the
whole time of Saul’s reign is described, ver. 1, then will arise this
difficulty: to wit, how David—who began to reign at thirty years
of age, 2 Sam. v. 4, and therefore, if Saul reigned two years only,
appears manifestly to have been twenty-eight years of age, when
Saul began to reign, and consequently when he killed Golial],--is
advised by Saul, 1 Sam. xvii. 33, not to fight with Goliah, because
116 was yet but a youth (likewise 116 is called a youth, ver. 42) 3—
how, I say, is he called a youth, being in his nine and twentieth
year? Not to speak of those many battles that are said to have
been fought against so many people during Saul’s reign, 1 Sam.
xiv. 46, and in them the various conflicts betwixt David and the
Philistines, 1 Sam. xviii. 25. Then afterward his flight, and his
changing of his lurking places so often, because of Saul's mani-
sold persecutions. Lastly, David's dwelling among the Philistines
one year and four months, 1 Sam. xxvii. 7, compared with ch. xxix.

years, that is, some days or some yearS, and other things are men-
