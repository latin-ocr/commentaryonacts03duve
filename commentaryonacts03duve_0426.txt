They were baptizet} in the name of tlte Lord Jesus. That is, them
John initiating by baptism did dedicate unto Christ. Among
others, famous Drusius observed,¹ that this verse is taken, as if
they were Luke's words, which they are not. ‘⁶ The apostle Paul,''
saith he, “speaks of John's baptism, which he proves to be the
same with Christ's baptism, partly by his doings, partly by his say-n
ings, as being one that preached Christ to come, and baptized such
as believed in him ε and this is it which be saith, they were baptized
in the name of J esus ς such as, to wit, while John preached,
embraced the faith of Christ, of which number those disciples
were; but because those believers had not as yet received the gifts
of the Holy Ghost, therefore the apostle asks them, by whose

John to the Lord J esus :2 ‘I have need to be baptized (gftlzee, ancl comest

art wholly in the Fathcr? Shall I in the name of the Son? but
there is no other Son of ch by nature besides thee. Shall I in
the name of the Holy Ghost? but he is always together with thee,
as con-substantial to thee, and of the same will and judgment, and
of equal power and alike honour, and with thee he receives worship
from all men.'⁷
