years constantly kept in the Greek, Latin, Syriae, Ethiopic, and

Arabio books3 but the place and order of the number is various ’

and different in the different editions. “ For in the ancient Vul-
gate Latin translation,'' saith the reverend Usher, archbishop of
Armagh, Chron. Sao. p. 1, cap. 12, “they are thus rendered: ‘ He
divided their land to them by lot, about four hundred and fifty
years after, and afterwards he gave them judges ς’ even as J oannes
Mariana testifieth he found it written in some Greek manuscripts,
to wit, in the manuscripts of Petrus Taxardus‚ marquess of
Velesio, which are greatly suspected to have been designedly both
here and otherwhere confornied to the Vulgate Latin translation.
But the Alexandrian copy, which we have in England, written in
great letters, and of far greater antiquity than those cited by
Mariana, reads it thus, ‘ He divided their land to them by lot in
about four hundred and fifty years, and after that he gave them
judges.‘ The very same thing is also found in those divers readings
which Robert Stephen added to the New Testament, which he
printed in Greek at Paris, A.D. 1568. Also a certain Greek copy
published at Paris, and cited by Beza in his- annotations upon
this place, agreeing with it, and another manuscript of the new
college of Oxford, except only that this wants the pronoun ‘their '
after γῆν, land: in the other the pronoun ‘them’ is added after the
verb ‘he gave.’ In all which it is manifest, that those four hundred
and fifty years relate not to the continuance of the judges, but to
the time of the division of the land. Moreover, some very
learned men of our age, as Francis J unius relates, did think that
this circumscription of times doth belong to the former part of this
speech, even retaining the vulgar reading of the Greek copies, to
wit, that as they think some fit participle must be understood, as if
it were thus read: ‘ After the four hundred and fifty years were
(ended) he gave judges.’ By this means the beginning of this
account will depend upon the first words of the apostle's speech,
ver. 17, The G'ocl qs this people Israel chose ozcrfathera But when
God had promised to Abraham, as yet not having a son, that he
would give the land of Canaan to his seed, Gen. xii. 7 ; Acts vii. 5,
afterwards Ishmael, his first-born, being exeluded, the choice of
the fathers was made in Isaac, according to that, In Isaac shall thy
seed be called, Gen. xi. 12. Further, from the birth of Isaac until
the going of his posterity out of Egypt, there passed four hundred
years and five, to which add forty—six years and a half, which were
