which were taken about this island. Pliny6 commendeth the Samian
tile, wherewith the priests of the mother of gods, which priests

Mycale,'’ saith Herodotus, ¹⁰ ‘⁶ is a promontory of the continent
towards the west wind, belonging to Samos, at which promontory
the Ioniam, gathcring together out of all their citios, solemnizet]
