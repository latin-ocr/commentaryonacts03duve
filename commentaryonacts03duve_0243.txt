faith, repentance, and regeneration. This reflection of M. Bossuet‚
deserveth to be seriously considered, to wit, that this use of plung-
ing hath continued for the space of a whole thousand and three
hundred years, that hence we may understand that we did not
carefully, as it. was meet, examine things which we have retained
from the Roman chureh3 and therefore since the most learned
bishops of that church do teach us now that the custom established
by most grave arguments, aud so many ages, was first abolished by
her, this sels—same thing was very unjustly done by her, and that
the consideration of our duty doth require at our hands, that we
seek again the primitive custom of the church‚ and the institution
of Cl1rist.” The same person there a little afterward: ‘⁶ Though
therefore we should yield to M. Bossuet, that we are convinced by
the force of his arguments, that the nature and substance of bap-
tism consisteth in dipping, what may he hope for from us, but that
we profess ourselves obliged to him by no small favour, and thank

of their holy master, than to despise his voice, when his sound
cometh to their ears: My sheep follow my voz'ce; and again, I do
know my she-¹77. N one, except wolves lurking under a sheep-skin,
refuseth, and turneth from it.” So far our most learned Anonymus,
which is most agreeable to his admonition unto the papists barring
the laymen from the holy cup, in the preface of his forecited
answer to the treatise of the bishop of Meaux concerning the
communion under both kinds. “ There is no place therefore for
cogging in these things, for those that pretend the specious title
of received custom for the day’s practice, when J esus Christ and
his gospel is not the custom, but the truth. From the beyimzz‘wy
z't was so, says the same J esus unto them, who did object unto him
