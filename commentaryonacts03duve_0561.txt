since had been the king's dwelling-place. Again, it is commonly
believed that Paul arrived hither after shipwreck. Indeed, Con-
stantine surnamed Porphyrogennitus, thinketh that the Sclavenian
or Dalmatic Melita, was the placc of refuge to Paul in his ship-
wrcck. ‘⁶ This opinion,’' saith Bochart‚ in the place above quoted,
“seems to some probable. F irst, upon consideration that Paul is
driven up and down in Adria before his arrival to Melita, Acts
xxvii. 27. Hence they conclude that mention is made of an island
in the Adriatic Sea. Secondly, forasmuch as barbarians inhabited
the same, Acts xxviii. 2, 4, whilst the Greeks had the African
Melita in their possession long ago. Thirdly, because Luke makes
no mention of any town in the island Melita, and yet in the African
there is a town of the island’s name remaining to this very day.
But these small objections are not of such weight, as that thereby
the assent of any man should be denied to the common opinion
confirmed by the most solid arguments.

‘⁶ For, in tlte first place, while Paul was sailing close by Crete,
as you have it, Acts xxvii. 13, 14, there arose a tempestuous
wind, called Euroclydon, or as the Vulgate Latin interpreter reads
it, Euroaquilo, that is, the north—east wind: which reading being
admitted, the conclusion is plain, for the ship could not be driven by
the north-east wind from Crete into Sclavonia. The situation of
the places makes evident that this could have been brought about
by the south-east wind, and not by the north-west directly opposite
to the former. But read it which way you please, it is plain that
this wind Euroclydon drove them rather to the south than to the
north, seeing that the mariners feared to be cast upon the quick-·
sands of Africa by the violence of this wind, Acts xxvii. 17. Now
there had been no grounds for such a fear, supposing the ship to
be driven by this wind to Sclavenia, a coast opposite to Africa, and
the forementioned quicksands.
