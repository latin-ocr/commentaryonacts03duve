is made mention of, 2 Sam. viii. 3, “ when he fled from before the
face of David,''as the Hebrews express it, which fable the counter-
feit Joseph Ben. Gorion also relateth, lib. i. cap. 33 but the con-
trary appears from Ptolemy, with whom, ch. i. of his third book of
Geography, Puteoli and Surentum are distinct cities. Puteoli is
is now by the Italians called Pozzuolo, which is the same name a

a bridge, which were most four miles distant, either in emulation
of Xerxes, who bridged over the Hellespont, or that he had a

Thrasyllus, the mathematician, had foretold that Caius the emperor
should not more be emperor than he could ride upon horses over

Tullius Cicero,” saith Thomas de Pinedo, “called his village
Puteolanum, because it was near Puteoli, where AElius Spartianus,

Dieu, “is seldom put for παρὰ, ‘at ;’ yet it is not altogether out
of use, as, ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις, ‘at the doors,’ ‘at the gate,’ is in use
almost with all writers, and in Thucydides, lib. iii„ ἦν ἐπὶ ποταμῷ,
‘ it was situate by the river.'’‘

Seven days. To wit, as many as Julius the centurion had
appointed to stay at Puteoli, who had shown himself extraordinary
civil to Paul: as ye may sce above, oh. xxvii. 3, 43.

And so. After those fourteen days spent at Puteoli.
