HisromoAL INTRODUCTION. vii

J oseph Williamson‚ a privy counsellor and president of the Royal Society.
This work became very popular both among the clergy at home, and the
reformed churches abroad, who, in letters, urged the author to engage in
similar expositions of other portions of the Scriptures. Accordingly, in
1630, he published his “ Literal Exposition of the Minor Prophets,''
which was dedicated to Lord Heneage Finch, Baron of Daventry‚ lord
high chancellor, privy counsellor, and keeper of the royal seal.

The celebrity of this performance paved the way for another important
alteration os his religious opinions. The Bishop of London was so gratified
by it, and so highly estimated the commentator's abilities, that he studiously
encouraged him by every means, and gave him free access to his library at
all times. In that library, the bishop little thought of what would be the
consequence of his finding and perusing attentively, some of the writings
of the English Baptists, which he very soon began to suspect were in
accordance with the word os God. [n the bishop's household was a young
woman, a servant, who avowed baptist principles, and probably belonged to
a baptist church. She was much derided by her fellow servants for her
peculiar sentiments, but was no doubt amply repaid by an approving con-
science for her faithful adherence to what she deemed scriptural truth and
apostolic practice, and by the opportunity she had of obtaining for Du Veil
an interview with Hanserd Knollys, at the house of a nobleman where that
eminent individual was accustomed frequently to resort. He also became
still more intimately acquainted with the Rev. John Gosnold, a man of
great learning, whose conversation he found both pleasing and instructive,
and who doubtless aided his researches into the Baptist controversy. After
some time he was fully convinced on the subject, renounced the principles
of Paedobaptism, and joineer. Gosnold's cominunity.

His former friends, with the honourable exception of Tillotson‚ now for-
sook him, and he had to seek as he could, literary or other employment.
He had a mind, however, capable of rising superior to this unhappy sec-
tarianism; but was not improbably led by it to a closer examinatior] of
the earliest documents of the Christian church, and thus to confirm his
confidence in the sentiments which he had deliberately adopted. Vei-y
soon he applied himself to the task of producing his “ Literal Explanation
of the Acts of the Apostles‚’' in which he takes occasion, with much accuracy
of criticism to vindicate the principles and practices of the Baptists. M.
Claude, one of the most celebrated and learned of the F rench Protestants
at the time, though a Paedobaptist, wrote the following letter :—
