grown, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. Yet
in Josephus, Ant. lib. ii. c. 5, Thermutis acknowledgeth before the
king her father, that Moses was not born her son, but taken up:
“WVhom I have resolved to adopt for my son, and to make him
thy successor in the empire and government.'’ The same Josephus
addeth, “that Moses in his infancy cast upon the ground, and
trampled upon with his feet, the crown when it was put upon his
head by the king of Egypt in jest. Hence he was in great danger
of his life by the instigation of the Egyptian priests, but was
preserved by Thermutis.

introduced speaking thus of himself :—

“ Us while a child most cai-efully she breti,
And royally in disciplines instructed,
And as she had been my mother nourished.”

Moses. That he was named ὖ oachim at his circumcision, and
when he was received into heaven Melchi, Clemens Alexandrinus
Strom. i. reporteth, but whence he had it is uncertain. In Philo's
Antiquities‚ he is said to have been called Melchil by his mother.
Thermutis called him Moses, that is, “drawn out,” or taken out, to
wit,of the watcrs of the Nile, from Πηξᾯ, “he drew out,” “he brought
out,'’ Exod. ii. 10. Josephus believes that Moses was so called
from the Egyptian word Μῶ, “water,’' and ὑσῆς, “preserved,'’ which
comes from ὩῚΣἸΠ. From Μῶ also is Monius, as Abenezra affirms
he was called by the Egyptians. “Yca,” saith the most learned
Hoffman in his Universal Lexicon, ‘⁶ in some verses of Orpheus he
is called ὑδρογευὴς, that is, ὑδατογευὴς, as much as to say, ‘born in
the water.”⁷ But Salmasius, Ep. lx., thinketh that the etymology
of Moses is plainly Egyptian, and verbally it importeth, saith he,
“taken out of the water,'' as an old poet in Eusebius affirmeth,
that is Μωύσι; for Μωοῦ in that language signifieth water, σῖ, to
take.

In all the wisdom qf' tlze qupticms. The wisdom of the ancient
Egyptians chiefly consisted in hieroglyphics and mathematics.
The invention of geometry, seeing by reason of the inundation of
the Nile the bounds of their lands could scarce be distinguished,
is attributed to them.
