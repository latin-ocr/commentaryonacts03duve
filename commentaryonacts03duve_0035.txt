their hearts, believes what it sees not. The merit acerues by
believing3 the reward is seeing afterwards. Let the Lord go and
prepare a place. Let him go, that he may not be seen 3 let him
be eoneealed, that he may be believed: for then the place will be
prepared, when our life is according to saith. Lot us desire him
in whom we believe, that being desired he may be enjoyed. The
desire out of love is the preparation of the 1na11sion.”

He was Zzss'ted up. Supply out of Luke xxiv. 51, W hile lle blessed
tlzem. Thus Plautus uses the word, “ Take this stone‚'’ saith he,
“ and lift it up.” Sulpitius Severus bath these words :¹ “ This is
wonderful,” saith he, “that the plaee whereon Christ set his last
footsteps, when he was taken up in a eloud into heaven, should
still continue marked out, and could not be paved with the rest of
th‘e place about it. For whatsoever else was applied, the earth
disdaining human workmanship, refused, while the stones flew in
the faces of them that attempted it. Yea, it is such a lasting
monument of the dust being trampled by Divine feet, that the
impression of the footsteps still remains. And though the multi-
tude of believers every day earry away some pareels of the place
where our Lord set his feet, yet the saud is not diminished, and
the earth that received the mark of the footsteps still preserves the
same forln.” That men have endeavoured in vain from time to
time to cover or pave the plaee still preserving the footsteps of
our Lord, Pseudo-Jer0111e,2 Paulinus,³ and Bede,4 have delivered in
their writings. But in regard t-here is no mention made of any
such miraele either by Eusebius, Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomen,
or Nicephorus, we may thence conjecture the liberty which former
ages took to frame little stories of their own, merely to impose
upon the ignorant people. N either do the mythologists agree in
thisfable. For Baronius,⁵ following Burehardus, will have these
footsteps imprinted in stone, Paulinus in the green turf, Sulpitius
Severus in dust or sand, Pseudo-Jerome and Bede upon the
ground in the earth itself. Which of these must we believe Ρ Cer-
tainly none of them. Nor does Pseudo-Jerome affirm that he
ever saw these imprinted footstepS‚ but only sayS, “as is reported?
But one eye-witness is better than ten hear-say testimonies.
Hornius believes this fable arose from the words of Eusebius
misunderstood. For he, speaking of Helena’s arrival in Judea‚⁶
