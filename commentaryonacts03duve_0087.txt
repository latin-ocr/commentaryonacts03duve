into the Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, And that other, into
his death, is typically representing his death in baptism.'’ The
¹ same patriarch, in the same place, a little before, “What is said
in the Acts of those that had received the baptism of John, that
they were baptized in the name of tho Lord Jesus, denotes that
they were baptized according to the institution and doctrine of the
Lord J esus: as also when it is said in another place, that they
were baptized into ¹Christ and the death of Christ, we ought to
understand that the same sense is thereby signified3 that is to say,
they were baptized into the name of the Father‚ Son, and Holy
Ghost. For so the Lord J esus Christ both taught and commanded
his disciples to baptize.” John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury :l ‘⁶ To
baptize,'' saith he, “in the name of Christ, is so to baptizo, as Christ
instituted, commanded, and ordained. But those words, in tlte
name (ff Christ, signify no more that baptism was administered in
the only name of Christ, not of the Father and Holy Ghost, than
these words, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, argue that he was a
servant of Christ only, and not of the Father and Holy Ghost
also: or as if those words which Paul spoke to the keepcr of the
prison, believe in Jesus Christ, should be thought to free him from a
necessity of believing in the other two persons of the Trinity.”
Moreover, if there be any credit to be given to Pseudo-Abdias the
Babylonian, the apostles in the infancy of the church, when. they
baptized‚ used this form, “I baptize thee in the name of the Father,
and of his Son J esus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.’' PerhapS, to
the intent, that the name of J esus Christ, which was odious to the
Jews and Gentiles, might be advanced into honour, in regard that
the Holy Ghost was given in baptism upon the invocation of his
name. ‘⁶ Peter,” saith Cyprian,2 “ makes mention of J esus Christ,
not as if the Father were to be omitted, but that the Son might
be joined to the Fathe1·.” Hence, St. Austin uses this example to
weaken his adversaries' objection, where that Arian gainsays the
Holy Ghost to be the Creator, because it is said all things were
made by the Son :³ “If,” saith 116, “because the Spirit is not
named, therefore thou thinkest the Spirit of God not to be a crea-
tor, by the same reason you may as well say, they were not bap-
tized in his name, to whom St. Peter speaks, Repent, and let every
one of you be baptized in tlte name of Jesus Christ, because he does
