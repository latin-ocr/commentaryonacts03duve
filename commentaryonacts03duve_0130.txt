Ananias and Sapphira his wife were otherwise affected, who
having sold their possession, kept back part of the price, &a

Sold a possession. The Ethiopic renders the Greek word sig-
nifying possession, “vine,” as also he doth the word signifying
“land,’' in ver. 83 likewise the word signifying “field,'' ch. i.
183 the reason is, because most of their possessione in the land
of Canaan were vineyards. Hence the seventy render the H ebrew
word signifying vineyaffls, “ possessions'’ and “lands‚” Prov.
xxxi. 163 Hos. ii. 153 Joel i. 113 1 Chron. xxvii. 27.

the same author a little after saith: “There is a twofold fulness3
one of saith, whereby the heart of believers‚ being filled with holy
spirits, from the most sure promises of G0d‚ doth confidently, and
without sear despise all adversity3 the other of boldness, whereby
the heart of the profane being filled with rash spirits, proceeding
from a vain hope of safety, dares without fear adventure upon any
