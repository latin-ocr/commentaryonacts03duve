deprave the decrees3 for in me the Judge, both of quick and

20. Thac they abstaz'n from the pollutions of idols. That is, from
things that have been offered to idols, as appears. ver. 29. “ Meats
offered to idols (saith Curcellaeus,¹) James calls τὰ ἀλισγήματιι
τῶν εἰδώλων, ‘ pollutions of idolsz⁷ for ἁλισγὴμα signifies ‘pollu-
tion,' but not of any sort promiscuously, but only that which
proceeds from unclean meats, such as were those that Moses’s law
did forbid unto the Israelites, and specially things offered to the
gods of the heathen. Whence God, Mal. i. 7, complains, that the
Jews offered upon his altar, ἄρτους ἠλισγημέυους, ‘bread polluted3’
and we read of Daniel and his companions, whom N ebuchadnezzar
appointed to be fed daily with his victuals and of the wine whereof
himself drank, that they resolved not to be polluted from the king's
table, nor from his wine, Dan. i.; because they feared that amongst
the same there might be somewhat forbidden them by the law,
Lev. xi. Deut. xiv„ or offered to idols, touching which they had
this command: Thou skalt not make α covenant with the inhabitants
of the land [of Canacm] lest when they leave committed whoredom with
their θοῶς, and adored their imayes, some of them should invite thee to
eat of what they have sacrfficecl, Exod. xxxiv. 15. A dangerous
example of which there is, N umb. xxv. i., &c. Now things offered
to idols may be considered two ways, when the question is put
about eating themz—l. As flesh to be sold in the market, or
privately offered to us by an infidel that has invited us, at his own
private house. 2. As flesh consecrated to idols, and so having a
peculiar sanctity3 especially when it is caten in honour of some
certain false god, in the place where idols are kept, as it was the
manner to celebrate banquets in the sacrifices of the heathen.
And in both these respects they are considered by St. Paul, 1 Cor.
viii. and x. As to the former respect, to feed on idolothytos
(or things offered to idols) is a thing altogether middling or indif-
ferent, provided it be done without administering scandal to the
weak, 1 Cor. x. 24, 25, &c But in the latter regard, it is a thing
evil, as being eonjoined with the profession of idolatry, or which
may at least be so taken by those who know not our mind, and so
may give them a grievous occasion of scanda13 and hereunto apper-
