renders Elam, Gen. X. 22, by Churestan, which is the same with
Chuzistan. Hence Daniel, ch. viii. 2, places Shushan the metro-
polis of Susia, in the province of Elam 3 and Ptolemy, Pliny, and
Marcian, seat the Elymaeans not far from the mouth of the river
Eulaeus. And from hence lastly it is that Josephus makes¹ the

Cappadocia. This to the west is bounded by Galatia, to the
south by Cilicia, to the east by Armenia, to the north by part of
the Euxine sca, according to Ptoleniy.² The Cappadocians, in-
habitants of this country, were formerly called Leucosyrians, as
Pliny testifies, lib. vi. cap. 3, and Syrians, as Herodotus witnesses.³
Before the enlargemcnt of the Roman empire, they were first
under the Persians, and afterwards governcd by themselves in the
reign of Ariaratha, after whom reigned Archelaus, whose daughter
