vnn. xxm] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 29

in imitation of Beza, I put a comma after the copulative, and, so
that the sense is the same as if Peter had said, The same Spirit
which, Psal. lxix. 25, had foretold the death of J udas, and thereby
the vacancy of his function, foretold also that another was to be
substituted in his place, upon whom the honour of the hishopric,
of which Judas was deprived, should be conferred. “Where,”
saith Beza, “he calls the bishopric a ministry or function, as much

this properly against Doeg, the overseer of the king’s herds.
However, the appellations of pastors of sheep and of the flock,

He was taken up from us. That is, when ascending into heaven
he was withdrawn in a cloud from our sight.

To be ordaz'ned 1οἱτή us a witness of lais resurrection. That is to
say, in an apostolic degree and order. Here is required by Peter
an eye-witness, such as John the Baptist bespeaks himself to have

strengthening of belief. In the meanwhile, Peter strictly binde
