the greater was conterminous to AEolis, which in ancient times was
also called Mysia. Adramyttium was a very noted city, a colony
of the Athenians3 it had a harbour and road for ships, as Strabo
has committed to memory (lib. xiii.)‚ where he says the famous
orator Xenocles had his birth.

ship was bound for the maritime towns of Asia the Lesser, of which
Mysia is a part. The Greek vulgar Codexes have μέλλοντες πλεῖν,

We launched. Greek, ἀνήχθημεν, “ we were carried away,'' as
above, ch. xvi. 11 3 xviii. 213 xx. 3, 133 and below, ver. 4.
