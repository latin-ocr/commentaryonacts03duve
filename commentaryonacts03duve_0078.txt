58 THE Ac'rs or THE HoLY Aros'ans [CHAP. 11.

saith St. Austin,¹ ‘⁶ but the hatred of sin and love of God.” See
my annot. upon Matt. iii. 2, 8, in that edition² which I dedicated
to the Right Honourable Henry Compton, Lord Bishop of London,
whose most ardent zeal for true religion and virtue, and most
liberal and munificent charity both to me and the rest of the
French Protestants, no oblivion can ever be able to obscure.

And be baptized‚ &c. That is, according to the command of
Christ, let every one of you, struck with a real sorrow for his
sins, be plunged in water3 because that sacred immersion has been
instituted by Christ, like a certain signet, diploma, or patent, by
which he confirms the remission and utter defacing of their
sins to all those who seek to him with an unfeigned faith, as the
only Physician of their souls3 so that their sins shall never more
be remembered or imputed to them.

The sacred ceremony of baptism is not to be performed by the
sprinkling only, or pom-ing on of a little water, but by the
plunging of the whole body of them that are to be baptized3 as,
first, the proper signification of the Greek word baptizo declares*
‘⁶ This,” saith Casaubon,³ “ was the rite of baptizing, that persons
were plunged into the water, which the very word baptizo
sufficiently demonstrates. Which as it does not extend so far as
to sink down to the bottom, to the hurt of the person, so is it not
to swim upon the superficies. Therefore we are apprehensive that
it is not without cause what some have disputed, that baptism
ought to be administered by plunging the whole body into the
water, for they urge the word baptize.'’ See our annot. chap. i.
ver. 5, and our literal explication, Mart. iii. 6 and Mark i. 5.

Secondly. The example of Christ, Matt. iii. 16, and Mark i. 9.
WVhence the Synod of Calcuith, A.D. 816,4 where Wulfrid, arch-
bishop of Canterbury presided. “ Let,’' saith he, “the presbyters
beware, that when they administer the sacrament of baptism, they
do not pour water upon the heads of the infants, but let them be
always plunged in the font, according to the example of the Son
of God himself, who was thrice plunged in the waters of Jordan.
Thus must this ceremony be performed according to order.'’ See
our lit. expl. Matt. iii. 15.

Thirdly. The constant practice of the universal church till the
time of Clement V„ who was crowned pope anno. 1305, under
