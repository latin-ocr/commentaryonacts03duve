‘⁴ Sir,—

“ 1 received your Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles which you
were pleased to send me, and give you a thousand thanks for the share
which you are thus so kind as to afford me in your remembrance, which Ι
have entertained, not only with all due acknowledgment, but also with
much joy, as coming from a person who is and ever shall be very dear to
me, aud for whom Ι have a most particular esteem. Ι have perused your
Commentary, though it came but lately to my hands, and Ι have found in
it, as in all your other works‚ the marks of a copious reading, abundance of
sense, right reason, and a just and exact understanding; and I do not
doubt but that this Commentary will be kindly received by the learned,
and prove very usesul to all those who apply themselves to understand the
Scriptures. This shows you, Sir, not to be idle, and that you manage
well the talents God has been pleased to bestow upon you. The public
will be very much obliged to you, if you continue, as I hope you will, and
which I take the freedom to exhort you todo, to make similar presents.
For my own part, Ι find in it a great edification‚ and wish with all my
heart, it lay in my power to manifest it to you by effectual services. Ι
beseech you to be persuaded of this truth, and that you would preserve me
the honour of your friendship, which Ι shall ever look upon as very much

to my advantage. I take my leave, praying God he would continue to
pour out upon you his holy benedictione: assuring you that Ι am,
‘⁴ Sir,
“ Your most humble aud most obedient servant,

By comparing the Commentaries of Du Veil⁷ and particularly this of
the Acts of the Apostles, with others, their real value will be more distinctly
seen. This Commentary, like most that he has produced, holds a kind of
middle place between those of an elaborate description, and those which,
the expression being allowed, we may term more densely critical. He does
not expatiate on the general truths he discovers for the purpose of spiritual
improvement, likc chry; nor interweave theological sentiments or ques-
tionings, with vast masses of rabbinical or other foreign literature in the
form of long and learned citations like Gill, some of which are, but many of
which are not really illustrative ; and on the otherh and, he does not, like
the German criticS, such as Roseumuller‚ trave] down the rugged path of
