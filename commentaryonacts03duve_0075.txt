VER. XXXI.] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 55

1 Cor. iv. 15. But the ambition of these persons increasing‚ the
chief archbisbops, whom they called bishops of the highest seat,
usurped this title to themselves3 till at length four of them
obtained this title to be confer-red upon them principally above all
the rest3 the patriarchs of Rome, of Alexandria, of Antioch, and
Jerusalem to whom was added at length the patriarch of Con-
stantinople, made the second, by reason of the new Rome's dignity.''

Is dead. He died on the feast of Pentecost, if we may believe
the Jerusalem Talmud.

His sepulchre. With which the bones and ashes of David are
covered.

30. Of the fruit of lzz‘s loins. The words are taken out of the
132nd Psalm, ver. 11, where the Greek has it, “of the fruit of
thy belly;” that is, by the birth of thy wife. The same sense
answers to both. There is added here in the Greek text, “to
raise Christ according to the flesh.” But there is no reason
appearing why this addition, which the Greek copies have, and
Chrysostom has expressed, should be brought into the least sus—
picion of being untrue. “For,” saith the learned Ludovicus de
Dieu, “when Luke does not relate what was singly sworn to
David, but what David as a prophet knew to be sworn to him, it
did not behove him barely to recite the words of the promise, but
to explain how David as a prophet understood them. God had
promised to David, that he would settle in his throne one of the
fruit of his loins3 that David, as a prophet, knew to be nothing
else but that God would raise Christ according to the flesh, from
the fruit of his loins, to sit upon his throne.’⁷

To sit upon his throne. Christ is said to sit upon David’s throne,
because he was designed by God to be his successor, who after a
celestia] and divine manner should reign over the house of Jacob,
that is, the people of God, over whom David had received from
God the earthly dominion. F or which reason Christ himself
affirms that he has the key, that is, the power and empire of
David, though his throne be not established upon earth, but
translated to heaven, and that all powers both in heaven and
earth are subjected to his empne, together with angele, good and
evil, all people, tongueS, nations, and even death and hell itself.

31. He seez‘nfs tlzz's bffffl'e· As if he had said, David understand—
ing by the spirit of prophecy, that it was promised him that Christ
should be raised from his seed, by the same prophetie knowledge
