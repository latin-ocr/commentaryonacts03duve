mically the things hoped for, as appears by what follows. Some
expound that hope of the resurrection of the dead, of which above,
ch. xxiii. 63 xxiv. 15. But others take it for the hope of the
deliverance of the Jews by the hlessiah, or of salvation to be
obtained by Christ, Nor without reason3 for although here below,
ver. 8, there is expressly mention made of the raising of the dead,
yet that does not militate against this opinion, which may be seen
there. Again, the raising up of the just that are dead is com-
prehended in that hope of salvation by Christ, as being of larger
extent. Moreover, it cannot be clearly shown that the promise of
the resurrection of the dead was made by God to the fathers of the
JeWS, which is here immediately subjoined. But it is manifest
that it was made of Christ, not obscurely, but expressly, as we
shall straight see. To pass by that, what is spoken in the follow-
ing verse can scarce be rightly said of the hope of the resurrection,
to wit, that the twelve tribes of Israel hoped that they should
come to it; seeing there were many among those twelve tribes
who had no persuasion of the hope of the resurrection of the dead,
as the Sadducees, and those who favoured their opini0n.”

“Paul,” saith WVolzogeniuQ “everywhere preached the Messiah
promised by God of old, and then as yet hoped for by the Jews,
but really already shown, and that that Messiah was J esus, whom
God raised up after that he was crucified by the J ews3 and for
this very reason was he persecuted by the Jews.”

7. Unto which. That is, for the obtaining of which promise.
The sense of this whole verse is the same as if he had said: But
whosoever of our nation carefully worship God, and exorcise them·
selves night and day in the duties of godliness, they are inflamed
with this hope, that they will sometime obtain that everlasting sal-
vation and blessed immortality, which the Messiah, the author of
salvation‚ will bestow on all them that obey him.
