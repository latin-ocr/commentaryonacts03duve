literally and properly they are not to be understood of David, but
of Christ, of whom David [was] made a representation.

Os the. patriarch David. Patriarclz, is a compound Greek word
of patria, signifying “familyj’ and arche, “ beginning.” However,
every father of a family is not called a patriarch by the Hellenists,
but only they who in Hebrew are called the heads, or chief of the
fathers; that is, the fathers of the fathers of a family, and the
founders of the whole family and kindred, They are called the
lzeacls of the fathers, Exod. vi. 253 and 1 Chion, ix. 9, patriarch-5.
And thus David is properly called a patriarch, because he was the
founder of the royal family3 which is called in Greek patria,
“lineage‚'' Luke ii. 4. And so below, ch. vii. 8, 9, the
twelve sons of Jacob are called patriarchs, because the several
tribes derived their names from them, as being the founders of
their race, and deduced their original from them, So Abraham is
called a patriarch, Heb. vii. 4, because the whole race of the elect
people of God descended from his loins. There were also other
patriarchs improperly so called, not in respect of pedigree, but in
regard of their superiority and precedency. Thus they, whom the
author of the Chronicles calls princes qs the tribes of Israel, 1 Chron.
xxvii. 22, the Greeks call patriarchs of the tribes, and in this
sense also King David, advanced to the most supreme degree of
dignity, might be styled a patriarch. Such were the patriarchs
improperly so called, whom the Hellenist Jews, after the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem, chose for their chieftains. “Therefore,” says
the learned Heidegger,² ‘⁶ Hadrian to Severianus the consul makes
mention of the patriarch of the Jews dwelling in Alexandriae
Epiphanius also relates in his disputation against the Ebionites,
‘That some part of the «Jews in his time inhabited the city of
Tiberias, who acknowledged a head or supreme, to whom they
gave the title of patriar0h3 to whom also were joined several
assistants, who were called apostles.’ From which custom to think
that Christ gave to his disciples the name of apostles, is a gross
niistake of Baronius,³ as Casaubon learnedly makes out. But in
the Christian church, as being a spiritual family, after the passion
of Christ several bishops were called fathers, and archbishops
patriarchs; that is to say, chief among the fathers. Whom it was
lawful to suffer, if not as fathers, at least as pedagogues in Christ,
