citizens by the Latins were called Syracusans. It hath produced
several men famous for learning, amongst the rest Flavius Vopis-
cus the famous historian, Philemon the comio poet, but Archime-
1105, 1110 geometrician and excellent mathematician, hath surpassed
them all in fame, whose sepulchre Cicero, Tusc. Quaest. lib. v.‚
makes his boast that he found out among briers and brambles,
when it was unknown to the Syracusans. But I know not on what

Strabo, in the fore-cited sixth book, and Eustathius on Dionysius's

the first of that name, king of Sicily, and repaired by his son, and
called Phoebia, and that 11 was augmented by Augustus Caesar, out
