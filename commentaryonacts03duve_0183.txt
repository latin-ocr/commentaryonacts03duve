vsu. xxm] LlTERALLY EXPLAINED. 163

Epistle of J ude, saith, that the devil contended chiefly about the
body of Moses as unworthy of burial on that reason chiefly, for
that he killed the Egyptian unjustly.

Smote tlte Eyyptz'an. The scripture hath not expressed the
manner how he smote him. The ancient Hebrews, as Clemens
Alex. Strom. i. testifies, do also fictitiously and fabulously report,
that the Egyptian was not killed by Moses with any externa]
weapon, but by the bare pronouncing of the name Jehovah against
him3 as Peter did kill Ananias and Saphiras by a mere word.
Sulpicius Severus saith,1 “ Moses, when he was come to a man’s
age, seeing a Hebrew beaten by an Egyptian, moved with grief,
revenging his brother's wrong, kicked the Egyptian to death.'’

25. For lae supposed, διο. As if he had said, he thought that
they would understand, when they saw him so ready to defend his
brethren when wronged by their enemies, that they were to be
delivered afterwards by God from the tyranny of the Egyptians
by his means, which yet they did not understand. By this
testimony of Stephen, RIoses seems to have killed the Egyptian
011 this account, as being acquainted with his call to deliver the
Israelites from the grievous bondage of the Egyptians 3 which the
scripture is silent in, Exod. ii. 12. This Augustine observed in
his second question on Exodus.

26. And tlze next day. That is, the next day after that Moses
killed the Egyptian, and covered him with sand after he had killed
him.

He shewed himself to them as they strove„ That is, 116 saw two
Israelites quarrelling, [conspexit duos Hebraeos rixantes] as the
Vulgate Latin interpreter rendere it, Exod. ii. 13. Jonathan and
Rabbi Solomon say, that these two Hebrews that contended were
Dathan and Abiram.

And lte would have set them at one affaire. Greek, And he forced
them to peace, [συνήλασεν αὑτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην] That is, he used
all means to reconcile them. “The name of the effect,’' saith
Grotius, “is given to the endeavour;” and the word signifying
as it were, “violence,’' denoteth the earnestness of the agent, as
ἀναγκάζειν, “to constrain,” Luke xiv. 233 and παραξιάζεσθαι, “to
use forceable means,⁷' Luke xxiv. 29. See the like expressions,
Gen. xix. 3, xxxiii. ll, in the Vulgate Latin 123 Matr. xiv. 223
Mark vi. 453 Gal. ii. 14.
