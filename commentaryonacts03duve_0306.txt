books of Moses only are called the law, are given by the author of
obn> n: brt, because these books of Moses were given to all ages.
But the prophets’ sermons are rrbnprr *πει-τ, because they received
every prophecy from the Holy Ghost, according to the exigence of
the time, or of any fact. “Which reason,” saith Ludovicus de
Dieu, “is not altogether to be despised.’' But the five books of
Moses, being divided into fifty—four sections, which they call
ΠἾἻΒἾΞ, are read yearly by the Jews in their synagogues. They
begin the reading of them the next sabbath after the Feast of
Tabernacles, and thenceforward they read one section every sab-
bath-day, except two, whereon they join two lesser sections, to be
read together at once, that so, in a year’s time, all may be read
over, and may be finished the ninth day of the feast of Taber-
nacles, which, therefore, the Jews call ΠἾἾΠ rii-mm, “the gladness of
the law.” There are some that do not read over the whole law
but once in three years: ‘⁴ but this is not the cust01n,'' saith Mai-
1nonides3 in summa Tahnudica tract. de precibus, &c., Benedict.
sacerdotum, cap. 13.

And tlte prophets. Every sabbath day the Jews read a section
taken out of the prophets in their synagogues, answering to the ”
lesson read out of the Pentateuch. And they call it the Dismis-
sion, because the prophetical section being read, the people are dis-
missed. “Antiochus Epiphanes,” saith Elias in his Thisbi, “did
by an edict forbid the ‘Israelites the reading of the law.- that did
the Israelites do? They took one section out of the prophetS,
whose matter was like the things which were treated of in that
section of the law which was assigned for that sabbath. As for
example, upon that sabbath whereon that section zrmmn, should be
read, they read out of the prophecy of Isaiah, ch. xlii. 5, Thus saith
the L0rd‚ tlte Lord chat created tlte lzeavens, &c.; but when the sec-
tion of Noah, Gen. vi. 1, was to be read, they substituted a section
answering to it out of Isa. liv. 9, For tlzz's is as tlte waters (ff Nocdz
‘emto md’ And so also of the rest of the sections. But now,
though this decree of Antiochus be void, yet that custom of read-
ing sections taken out of the prophets, accommodated to the sec-
tions of the Pentateuch, is not taken away 3 for even to this day
they read such sections as these of the prophctS, after the section
of the law.
