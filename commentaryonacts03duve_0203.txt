which afterwards is more clearly expressed, Isa. lxvi. 1, 2, to wit,
that all things are filled with the majesty of God, and that they
wrong him who dream that he is tied to a temple made with
hands, and after a childish manner think that they deserve at his
hands by doing of things of nothing.

49. The heaven, &c. As much as to say, Ι, who am every-
where, and govern all things, have no need of a temple made by
men3 I called indeed the temple, which Solomon set about at my
command, my rest, Ps. cxxxii. 14, not that my glory is compre-
hended in its narrow bounds, or that I delight in a visible and
fading building‚ but- that I would have that to be the sign and
pledge of my presence to those who worship me with an inward
purity of heart, and a sincere affection of godliness. See our
literal explication, Matt. v. 34, on these words, Is Gocl's throne.

seeketh us, not our possessions, which we obtain from him only at
his pleasure, by his free grace. And hence it is also manifest,
what a vast difference there is betwixt true religion, and the carnal
inventions of men.''

51. Osa stg'ff neck. In the Greek, as also the English, “stiff-
necked:’' that is, untractable and refractory. See our literal
explication on Hosea iv. 16. “Seeing Stephen does not give
direct answers to the heads of his accusation, I willingly am of
their mind,” saith Calvin, “ who think that he would have spoken
more, had not his discourse been tumultuously interrupted. For
we know what a consistory of judges he had. VVherefore it is no
wonder if they forced him to hold his peace, with their tumultuous
noise and mad outcries. And we also see that of purpose he used
