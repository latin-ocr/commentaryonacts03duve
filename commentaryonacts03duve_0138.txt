to a shameful death upon the cross. In allusion to that place,
Deut. xxi. 22, 23.

31. Hc'm Izatlz Gocl awlted a Prz'nee, and α Saviour. There is an
ellipsis here of the preposition in, so that the sense may be, that
Christ, whom you have condemned to be shamefully hanged, him
bath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, or hath constituted
in the supreme degree of honour, that he might be more fully aud
perfectly the Prince of life, to wit, eternal, and the Captain of
salvation„ See above, ch. iii. 153 Heb. ii. 10, v. 9.

With, lais riylct hand. That by the right hand of ch here, being
a metaphorical expression, is understood his power and great
virtue, is clear unto all. “If ever since the creation God did
manifest it, surely it was in this work of Christ's exaltation.
thencc Paul doth deservedly celebrate it in these words: Aml
‘wlzat is tlte exeeedz'ny yreatness of lais power to its-ward who believe,
accordiny to tlte workc‘ny of leis misslztgs power which lte wrozcffln‘ in
Christ, when he raised lzc'm from tlte dead, and set him at llis own
rz'yht hand in lzeavenly places, Eph. i. 19, 20. For what can be
conceived more noble than to endow with immortality a man that
was born like other men, subject also to the same infirmities with
them, except only sin, and then set him above all the heavens, and
to put all things under his feet, as well in heaven as in earth, that
he might govern and manage them at his pleasure? For it
appears by the circumstances, that all these things are compre-
hended under Christ’s ascension and exaltation to heaven, and not
a mere lifting up to heaven, such as was Enoch's before the law,
and Elias’s under the law, who neither died before they were
lifted up, nor attained to any dominion after. For these, although
they were preludes and types of Christ’s ascension, as of ours also,
yet were they infinitely short of it.’' ¹

To (sive, &c. As much as to say, that of his great mercy he
might bring his people to repentance3 and by forgiveness of sin,
which follows repentancc quickened by faith, reconcile them to
himself. Calvin saith well, “Repentance is indeed a voluntary
conversion. But whence cometh this willingncss, except that
(jod change our heart, that of stony it may become fieshy3 of hard
and stubborn, tractable3 and, lastly, of crooked, straight? But
this is done when Christ by his Spirit renews us; neither is this
the gift of one moment, but must be daily increased all our life,
