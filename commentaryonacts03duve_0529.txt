villains. Sec above, ch. viii. 3; xxii. 4.

And when they were put to death. To wit, the Christians by the
uubelieving Jews.

Iyave my voice. That is, I gave my approbation to the mad-
ness of those unbelieving «Jews, and by my suffrage, approved of

their bloody cruelty, whereby they destroyed the Christians.
See above, ch. viii. 1 3 xxii. 20.

11. And z‘n every synaqoyue. By the name of syyzayoque, are
usually denoted the places where the Jews made their public

prayers, as also frequently their juridioal and civil conventions, as,
1 Mac. vii. 12, the additions to Daniel xiii. 41. It is also used for
Christian assemblies met to perform divine service, -James ii. 2.
Here therefore by synayoyues may be understood, either those
meeting-places of the Christians, into which Paul sometimes vio-
lently broke in, and haled them forth to insupportable torments,
or the juridical and civil assembling places of the JeWS, before
whom the Christians that were apprehended by Paul were brought3
or finally, the places appointed for prayer, in which, it is not im-

Jew that was scourged in a synagogue, when he was descrting
the Jews and turning over to the Christians. And in Eusebius,¹

Commodus, where it is said, that no woman of that flock “was
either punished with stripes, or stoned in the synagogue of the Jews.''

this was (lone in the time of the persecutions by some that were
not found Christians, Pliny witnesseth, lib. x. epist. 97, to Trajan
the emperor.

And beinq exceedinqu, &c. As if he had said, But further, my
mad rage against the Christians increasing every day, I was not
satiated with tormenting them all manner of ways at Jerusalem
only, but carried on that inhuman prosecution of them further,
even to cities situate without Judea.

these things, or exercising myself in these things, as above,
