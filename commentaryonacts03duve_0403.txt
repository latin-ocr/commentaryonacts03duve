VER. XXV.] LITERA LLY EXPLAINED. 383

the dialogue whose title is Philopater, and by some ascribed to
Lucian, swears by the “unknown G0d,” which was in Athens 3
ancl at the end of the same dialogue he saith: “ We having found
an unknown God at Athens, and worshipping with hands spread
out to heaven, to him we will give thanks.⁷'

Hz‘m therefore, &c. As much as to say, Therefore that Deity
which, confusedly known, ye worship, I declaro to you distinctly
and clearly to be God, the Maker and Governor of this worldly
fabric.

24. God, &a As much as to say, This true God, who created
and made heaven and earth, and produced all things that are con-
tained within the compass of heaven and earth, seeing 116 is Lord
of this universe as of his own work, cannot be enclosed in temples
made with men’s hands, as the earthly kings are in the palaces
wherein they dwell. See what is cited out of the Greek poet
Euripides in the Latin edition of this Commentary.

Dwelletlz notin temples made with hands. See what we have said
above, ch. vii. 48. The ancient Christians called the places of
their meetings, churches, conventicles, dominica, oratories, basilios,
and God's houses. But they gave the name of temple commonly
to the idols’ places only, although Lactantius¹ calls the “temple of
God,” a building dedicated by the Christians to religious worship.
St.. Jerome, in his Epistle to Riparius, saith of Julian the Apos-
tate: “That either 116 destroyed the basilios of the saints, or
turned them to temples.'' And by Tertullian,‘³ 116 is said to re«
nounce the temples, who hath renounced the idols.

25. Neitlzer is lle worslzz‘ppd with men's hands, as thousslz lie needed
mzytlzz'nfs. That is, neither do religious men offer their worship to
God, as it were with their hands, as if he had need of that worship,
but because it is a human duty. The same is the meaning of
Ps. l. 10—13.

Seee'ny lze. The meaning is, Seeing 116, by his free bounty, is the
cause of life to all living, and supplies them with abundance and
plenty of all things that nature wanteth.

Llfi' (md breatlz. That is, tlte bream qs* lgssfe, as is clear from Gen.
ii. 7. “ G0d,” saith Grotius, ‘⁶ is the Fathcr of spirits, Num, xvi,
22, that is, the author of life to all living, especially to men, as
having, like God, gotten the dominion of themselves and of other
things.”
