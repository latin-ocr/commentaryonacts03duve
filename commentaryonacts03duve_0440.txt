420 THE Acrs or THE HOLY APOSTLES [CHAP. xlx.

Cicero of the image of Ceres at Enna, saith: “It was such that
men thought, either they saw Ceres herself, or an image of Ceres,
not made with human hand, but fallen from heaven.” Pliny
admires¹ that Mutianus, who was three times consul, who says:
That the name of the artist, who engraved Diana's image at
Ephesus, was Demonicos, seeing he said that this image was not
only ancienter than Father Bacchus, but than Minerva also,
whose figment they report, not being made by the hands of any
artis‘t, to have fallen from heaven. Many of the ancients doubted
what matter the Ephesian idol of Diana was made of, many gave
out that it was of wood‚ but differed about the kind of wood.
But Xenophon reported it was of gold, which is made the more
probable, seeing that when Diana’s temple at *Ephesus was burnt,
that image was not consumed by the fire, neither was it ever
changed, though the temple was seven times repaired.

36. Seez'ny then that these tlzz'nys cannot be spoken against. As
much as to say, Whatever be said of images made with hands,
cannot prejudiee the image of Diana of the Ephesians, since it is
manifest that it was made by the hands of no artist, but fallen
from Jupiter.

You ouylzt to be quiet. That is, to quiet the multitude.

And to do nothiny ⁷·aslely. Without full discerning and clear
knowledge of the cause.

37. For με lzave brouyht hither these men. To wit, Gaius or
Caius, and Aristarchus, of which see above, ver. 29.

Neither robbers of eburones. To wit, of Diana’s temple, seeing
they were never within it.

Nor yet blasphemers of your ¹qoduless. To whose image, since it
was sent from heaven, its worship is beyond debate, although it
were granted they are no gods, nor to be worshipped for gods,
which are made with hands, as has been said, ver. 26.

38, Wherefore {f Demetrius, &c. Most like to which, is that ot
Horace:—

“ If any make lew'd verses againt any, there is law and judgment.¹’

The law is open. That is, there are times and places appointed,
in which justice is done, and controversies decided.

And there are deputer-5¹. There used to be one (leputy in each
province, but here are more mentioned, either because at divers
times one succeeded another ς or because that with the proconsul
his vicar or licutenant judged.
