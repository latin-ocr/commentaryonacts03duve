menced3 which may not be unfitly said of Annas the high priest,
and Caiaphas, with other senators of the Sanhedrim, mentioned in
Acts iv. So that the reason is easily given, why Caiaphas, by
«Iosephus said at that time to have been invested with the sacred
dignity as the successor of Aaron, is set after Annas. For the
father was alway second to the prince of the Sanhedrim. Neither
was the office of prince or father of the Sanhedrim perpetual, but
translated from one to another, as occasion required. Which is
apparent out of the Talmudic title, Horjaoth, ch. iii, and other
treatises of the rabbies. And perhaps at that time it was annual,
lest the prolongation of that authority might be a prejudice to the
rest of the kindred of the high priest. And hence, perhapS, that
other question is to be resolved concerning the high priesthood of
Caiaphas, noted by his year in the Gospel of St. John. For as
the plural number of high priests, in the sacred relations of the
administration of civil eoncerns, signified judges and presidents of
courts‚ as it has been said already, so the title of high priest in the
singular number, with the account of his year, may seem to denote
the prince of the Sanhedrim. So that in the fifteenth year of
Tiberius, Annas was prince, and Caiaphas was father of the San-
hedrim, Luke iii. 1, 2. But in the Passion year Annas was
father, and Caiaphas prince, Afterwards Annas as being most
eminent among his people again prince, and Caiaphas father, as in
Acts iv. And certainly Ananias the high priest, Acts xxiii. 5,
where he presides in the Sanhedrim, is acknowledged prince of the
people, which perhaps was the same thing with prince of the
Sanhedrim. There are many other places in the New Testament
to be expounded perhaps, by such an observation. Nor let any
one object, that thereby it might come to pass, that the high priest
advanced to the dignity of the sacred function, should give place
to the prince of the Sanhedrim in the time of his being only
father, and, consequently‚ be inferior to him in that state of com-
monwealth. For that was so true, as to the civil administration of
government, of which we discourse, that the high priest himself
was not only obnoxious to the jurisdiction of the great Sanhedrim,
but also of the inferior Sanhedrims, as is frequently to be seen in
the Talmud and other writings of the Jews. So that it is no
wonder that he, as a member of the great Sanhedrim, should
be but next in authority to the prince of the Sanhedrim. It
is to be noted also, that the mast learned rabbies instruct us,¹
