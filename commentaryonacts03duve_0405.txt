he did east out devils, Matr. ix, 243 xii. 24. The Vulgate Latin
hath it, “In the Prince.’⁷ As also below, ver. 31, 116 is to ιῘῑιιζᾳε
the world by that Man whom lae laath appointed, there it is also, in
that Man, meaning our Lord J esus Christ. The meaning then is,
by God’s power we are created, and being created, are preserved,
nourished, sustained, and enjoy what is sufficient both for necessity
of life and pleasure.

As certain also of your own poets have said. He mentions many
of them, because, in Homer, Hesiod, Menander, Callimachus,
Pindar, are some things which make to this purpose. But Paul
being a Cilician, cites only the words of his own countryman,
Aratus the Cilician. ’

For we are αῖῖ his offsprz'ny. This half verse is read in Aratus,
his Phenomena, which were translated out of Greek into Latin
by Cicero, while 116 was but very young, as he saith himself ;ι and
since, by Sextus Ruffus Avienus. It is agreed upon among the
learned, that Aratus being a man ignorant of astrology, did speak
most excellently and ornately of the heavens and stars, as Cicero
saith.2 This Aratus, surnamed Solensis, was born at Solis, a city
of Sicily, which being afterward repaired by Pompey the (Γπ-661,
was called Pompeiopolis 3 he was famous in the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphus, and lived splendidly in the palace of Antigonus
Gonata, the son of Demetrius Poliorcetzu who took the govern-
ment of the Macedonians, about the hundred and fifty-fifth
olympiad. Suidas makes a catalogue of his works, among which
his Phenomena are the most esteemed, whose admirable beginning
Virgil hath imitated in his third Eclogue, ver. 60. “What,'’
saith Grotius, “was said by Aratus of Jupiter, Paul adapteth to
the true God, because by Jupiter, the wisest among the Greeks
did understand the most high God. Thus Aristaeus, in Josephus,
says, That the Jews worship the God of the universe, whom the
Greeks call Jupite1·.”

forasmuch as we are the children of God. ‘⁶ Paul,” saith Grotius,
“accommodates himself to a poetical way of speaking, meaning
that we chiefly resemble God in our mind, and for this likeness
arc called his children. But in the N ew Testament we are called.
his children upon a more weighty account, because we imitate his
goodness3 again, we shall at our resurrection be otherwise his
children, by partaking of his blessedness.”
