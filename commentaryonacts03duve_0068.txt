our Saviour, Rom. x. 12, 13. But as the invocation of God is
not only taken for prayer directed to him, but frequently for any
act of divine worship 3 so is also the invocation of Christ, or of his
name, taken in the same sense, Gen. xii. 83 xiii. 43 xxvi. 253
1 Chron. xiii. 63 Psa. lxxix. 63 lsa. xli. 253 Jer. x. 253 Acts ix.
14, 213 1 Cor. i. 23 2 Tim. ii· 22. Now that the Christians
were freed from the common calamities of the «Jews in the
destruction of Jerusalem, we find in Eusebius :1 “But whereas the
whole commonalty and body of believers at the church of J eru-
salem, by oracular foresight inspired into some devout and holy
persons, were admonished to depart the city before the war, and
seat themselves in a town beyond Jordan,·called by the name of
Pella: and now all those that believed in Christ, having translated
themselves from the forsaken Jerusalem to Pella, then it was that
the royal city >and capital seat of the nation, being deserted by the
holy people, was overwhelmed by divine vengeance, for so many
crimes committed both against Christ and his apostles, so that the
whole race of those wicked people perislied.” See my annotations
upon Joel ii. 32.

22. Jesus of Nazareth. In the Greek, ‘⁶ J esus the N azarene,” who
being conceived, educated, and leading the most part of his life in
Nazareth of Galilee, according to the predictions of the prophets,
might well be called N azarene. See our literal explanation,
Matt. ii. 23.

Approvecl of God. As if he had said, The person whom God by
most powerful and not to be contradicted proofs, had demonstrated
to be by him to you sent, seeing that he wrought so many and
such great miracles in your sight, which no man could have
effected but by a divine power. The same also Nicodemus acknow-
ledged, John iii. 2. Master, said that great senator of the San-
hedrim, we know that thou comest from God, sor 720 man can work
those miracles which thou dost, unless God were with him.

Amony you. A Hebraism, for “to yon,'' that is to say, to be by
him sent to you.

By miracles, wonder-s, and εἴρηθ’. A synonym, which figure we
make use of when we think one word not sufficient to explain the
dignity and value of the thing. But why miracles are called both
miracles, wonders, and szynS, we have already declared upon Matt.
xxiv. 24.
