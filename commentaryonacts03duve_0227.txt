are clear of themselves, and that stand in need of no explieati0n3
but concerning mystica] propheoy‚ which, as long as it is not
accomplished, or although the accomplishment be come, being
unknown to any, is not well enough understood3 but if an inter-
pretation be made upon the present accomplishment, by a man
filled with the Spirit of God, the prophecy is very easy to be
understood, even as this potentate did know, and perceive pre-
sently the meaning of a very abstruse, and hard place, once only
proposed to him by Philip. “Nobly,'' says Augustin‚¹ “and
profitably hath the Holy Spirit so modified the holy scriptures,
that by very clear places he might satiate our hunger, by the
more dark rub off our contempt or loathings3 there is almost
nothing searched out of these obscurities, which may not be found
plainly spoken elsewhere.” Therefore in explaining the obseurer
places of scripture, the more learned are to be consulted, who are
much exercised in them3 but they are so to be consulted, that
they may make plain and evident to those that consult them, that
their exposition is the genuine and true sense of the scripture, but
not impose upon their consulters to yield to their interpretation
before they have tried it. For here Philip did inquire of the
potentate whether he did sufficiently understand what he did
read3 we must therefore know, and understand those things which
we are to believe.

And lze desz'red Philip, &c. Great was the modesty and hu-
manity of this potentate3 who not only suffered himself patiently
to be inquired at by a stranger, and mean born man, as it did
appear, but did confess his ignorance frankly and freely, did
invite him most lovingly to come up into his chariot to sit, and
confer with him, and to expound unto him the scriptures that he
did not understand.
