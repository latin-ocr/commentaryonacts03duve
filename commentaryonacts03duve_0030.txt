that power, which 1 know you want at present from heaven3 and
will fill your brcasts with the celestial spirit, that you may learn
with patience to expect the promised restoration of Israel's king-
dom, not the earthly as you vainly now dream, but the spiritual
dominion of the Jews: and in the meantime, be zealous to publish
to ull the world the doctrine of the gospel, and by your testimony
to confirm my resurrection, which not being believed the whole ⁷
gospel falls.

Anas με shall be witnesses unto me, &a St Austin 8111111,ὶ ‘⁶ It was
not so said to the apostles‚ yse shall be mimas—ses unto me, &c., as if
they alone to whom the words were spoken, were to fulfil so great
a trust, but as he seems to have spoken to them alone that other
saying of his, Beltold I am 202·th yon to the end of tlze world, &c.

all those things come to be fulfilled‘? How much more that, in
doing of which they were to bear a great share, though the same
act was also to be continued by their successors ⁴?'’

Isa. ii. 2, 3 3 Mich. iv. 1, 2. See what we have said upon the word
Jerusalem, Matt. ii. 3.

And in all Judea. The word Judea is herc used in the dilated
sense3 which, when Christ was upon the earth, was divided into
six parts3 to wit, into Galilee, Samaria, and J udea, strictly taken,
which lay on this side Jordan, and reached to the Mediterranean
Sea3 and into Trachonitis, Iturea, or Perea, and Idumen, that lie
beyond Jordan, and are seated in the midland country. Christ,
therefore, would have the Jews enjoy their privileges, till they
themselves, through their impicty and perverseness, forfeited and
lost them. For he does not indulge the preaching of the gospel
either to the Samaritans or Gentiles, before it was offered to the
nation of the Jews 3 for that he was sent by the Father [as] minister
of thc circumcision, to perform those promises which were formerly
