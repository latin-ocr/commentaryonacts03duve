Sea, above Crete, and leaving it on the left hand, we turned below
it, and so having it on the right hand, we encompassed it. “ These
phrases,” saith Lewis de Dieu, “ are still in use with mai-iners, that
as they sail by any place that is in their view, they are said to sail
above it when they are carried a straight course, under it when
they are forced to decline and tackle. The former is signified in
Greek by the word ὑπερπλεῖυ, the other by ὑποπλεῖυ. And there-
fore we applaud the most renowned Beza, who below, ver. 16,
renders, νησίον δέ τι ὑποδραμόντες, ‘and carried under a certain
little island.’ ’⁹ See what we have said above of the island of

Lystra is not a city of Lycia, but of Lycaonia, situate 111 the
continent, far from the sea, and therefore the Vulgate Latin
edition should be amended, and should be read, “ we came to
Lymira, or Limyra, or Lamira, or Myra.'’ Pomponius Mela
maketh mention¹ of a river called Lymira, and a town of the same
name in Lycia, near the sea3 and Pliny (Nat. Hist. v. 27),
Lymira, a city of Lycia, having its 1131110 from the river Lymirus,
which it is situate by, is mentioned by Strabo (lib. xiva), by
Ptolemy (lib. v. cap. 1), by Scylax in Lycia, and by Stephanus
Byzantius, who also writeth of Lamyra, a city of Lycia, in its own
place3 but seeing this author uses of one and the same city to
make several, I easily believe that it is the same town. Finally,

a town of the same name, on a hilloek, distant twenty miles from
the sea-shore, commonly called Strumita3 it is called by Ptolemy

plural, Myroi, in the rationary3 and by StephanUS, Μύρων. Lycia
was a part of the Asian province. “ First it was governed by the
