also Ptolemy, in his fifth book of Geography, eh. 16, and Pliny,
Hist. Nat. v. oh. 14, have made mention of it. The women of this
city are called, N eh. xiii. 23, ΠῬἾἾΞὮξδ, Azotides, whom the Jews
took for wives, and their sons did speak the language of Ashdod, as
is manifest out of the same chapter, ver. 24. Azotus is reported to
be distant from Gaza, (concerning which, above, ver. 26,) forty miles.

And passing] tlzrouqh, 810. As if he should say, Having gone
from Azotus to Caesarea of Palestina, he did preaoh the gospel in
all towns through which he went, even unto the end of his under-
taken journey. This Caesarea was at first called the Tower
of Strato, it was magnificently repaired by Herod the Great,
adorned with porohes and temples3 it was called by the same
Herod, Caesarea, in honour of Augustus Caesar, as Josephus wit-
nesses, Antiq. xv. 13. It was perfected the tenth year after it
was begun, as the same J osephus tells us, Antiq. xvi. 9. Eusebius
Pamphilius owed his birth to this city, and was afterward bishop
of the same. In like manner Aeacius, (who lived in the time of
the sophister Libanius,) whose life we have in Eunapius Sardinius,
and Procopius the rhetorioian and historian, seeretary of Belisarius
captain of Justinian the emperor, and fellow oompanion of all his
wars, of which he wrote the history. There was also another
Caesarea, different from this, toward Paneas, which, in Matt-
xvi. 13, and Josephus, Antiq. xx. 8, is called Caesarea Philippi, it
is called by Ptolemy, in his fifth book, oh. 15, Caesarea Panias‚
which King Agrippa the younger, when he did enlarge its terri—
tories, he changed its name, and in honour of Nero, called it
Neronias, as Josephus doth write in the place even now cited.
See our literal explication, Matt. xvi. 13.

Breallziny out tltrecctem'nsss and slauqltter ayainst the dz‘sez'ples. A
Greek phrase. That is, From the bottom of his heart breathing
out eruelty against the (lisoiples of Christ. So Cicero said, “ Cati-
ῙῘΠΘ, raging with boldness, breathing out wickedness, wiokedly con-
triving the ruin of, his eeuntry.”
