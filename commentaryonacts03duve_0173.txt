111111. xiv] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 153

which reason, not only those who actually entered Egypt with him,
but also Joseph and 1115 two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are
comprehended in the number of seventy, although they were 111
Egypt long before3 because, both as proceeding out of Jacob’s
loins, and being as to their original of the land of Canaan, they
were sti-angers in Egypt, and so were deservedly reckoned, as if
they had gone down into Egypt with Jacob. And it is of singular
moment in that catalogue, that. Judah's two grand-children by
PhareZ, to wit, Hezron and Hamul, although they were not then
born, as may be gathered from the series of time, but afterwards
in Egypt, are comprehended in that number, ver. 11, that they
might supply the place of the two sons of ι11111311, Er and Onan,
then deceased. For which reason also, N umb. xxvi. 21, whereas
in the rest of the tribes, not the grandchildren but only the
children make up the princes of the families, in the tribe of Judah
alone, not only his sons, Selah, Pharez, and Zerah, but also his

proceeded out of J acob’s loins, but did not send for all that came
out of his 101115. First, therefore, ‹Judah’s two grandchildren are
to be excluded there, then Joseph himself with his two sons; for
he could not send for those, as not yet born, nor himself and his
sons, as already dwelling in Egypt. Therefore if we subtract
these five, and then Jacob their father, who is mentioned apart by
Stephen, there remain of Moses' number of seventy, but sixty-
four: to wit, the eleven brethren, one sister Dinah, and fifty-two
sons of the brethren, to which, if we add the eleven wives of the
eleven brethren, which undoubtedly Joseph sent for together with
their husbands, and which belonged to the kindred, ye have 1115
whole kindred, seventy-five souls. The Ethiopic renders it, ⁶ And
«Ioseph after that 110 knew that, he commanded that they should
call his father, and all his kindred. And there came unto him
seventy—five souls.’ Which version excludes Joseph and his
children, because they could not be said to come unto him ; but in
that he errs, that he includes Jacob also in the number of the
