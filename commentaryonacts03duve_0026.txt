Pth’ch he had ehosen. That is, whom he created his messengers,
to publish the doctrine of the gospel two years before he suffered
over all Judea, and after his resurrection over all the world.
These messengers Christ called his apostleS, or envoys. Luke
vi. 13. Thus formerly the emperors of the east, and popeS‚
called their legates envoys, as is frequently apparent from Ana-

The blood and water flowing from his wounded side, was for a cer-
