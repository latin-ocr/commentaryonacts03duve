470 THE ACTs or THE nom( Arosrnns [CHAP. xxm.

St. Augustine, in Psalm eiii„ “ without is plaister, within, clay.”
Theophylaet, on this place: “ He calls him a whited wall, because
he had a fair aspect, as an assertor of the law, and one who pre-
tended to judge according to the law: but his mind was full of
wickedness.’' Truly and elegantly said Seneca‚¹ “ We admire
walls covered over with thin marble: when we know what it is
that is hid under it, we impose upon our eyes3 and when we value
things covered over with gold, what else do we but delight in a
lie, for we know that that under that gold, base wood is hid? Nor
are walls and beams the only things that are set out with orna-
ments3 the seeming happiness of all those who are exalted to high
promotion is but gilded3 look into them and you will perceive how
much evil lies hid under that thin membrane of dignity.”

For thou. Among the senators of the council.

Dost thou sit to judye me ιζίῖεν the law? That is, that thou
mayest judge according to the judicial law appointed by God in
the books of Moses. ‘⁶ The judicial law,” saith Grotius, “ was in
force as long as the commonwealth of Israel was in being, and the
Hebrew judges were obliged to give judgment according to it, within
those bounds of cognizance‚ which the Romans allowed them.’'

And contrary to tlte law. Unjustly beginning 'process of judg-
ment at execution: whereas the law enjoins to prosecute that
which is just justly, and not to commitw' iniquity in judgment.
Lev. xix. 153 Deut. i. 163 ch. xvi. 18—20.

Commandest. Actuated by a barbarous cruelty and tyrannieal
rage against the professors of Christianity.

Me. Without hearing my cause.

To be smitten. Contunieliously‚ viz. on the mouth.

4. And they that stood hy. Possibly the very same men who
were commanded by the high priest Ananias to sinite Paul on the
mouth.

Said. Vindicating the high pricst's honour.

Revilest thou ch⁷s lzz‘ylzb privat? That is to say, Thou foul—
mouthcd railcr, dost thou call him a painted and whited wall, whom
God has set over his Divine worship?

5. I mist not. Having been a considerable time absent from
Jerusalem. Others will have I wist not to import the same as,
I did not consider3 viz.9 being hurried with a sudden perturbation
of mind, when Ananias commanded 1116, without cause, to be smit-
ten on the mouth.
