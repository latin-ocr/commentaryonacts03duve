316 THE Acrs or THE nom APOSTLES [CHAP. xv. -

to Matthias and J ames surnamed the just3 the provinces to the
Mediterranean sea to John and Andrew3 the west to Peter and
James the son of Zebedee3 but all the world alike to Paul: whence
in some calendars of the Roman church‚ the separation of the
apostles is celebrated on the fifteenth of J uly3 but as to the year
when the same happened, there is almost everywhere a total
silence. There is another division of their work made amongst
the apostles, mentioned Gal. ii. 7 ς viz„ how the gospel of the un-
circumcision was committed to Paul, and that of the circumcision
to Peter3 but that relates not to this place. This council at Jeru-
salem seems to have been holden after that first separation of the
apostles, and that there were then no more apostles residing in that
city but Peter and J ames, who also alone are said to have delivered
their sentence in that council; although I think we ought to
add unto them, John, who is mentioned Gal. ii. 9. For that
which Paul says there, ver. 1, that he after fourteen years went up
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus with them, appears
by the circumstances which he there recounts, to be meant of this
journey which he made thither, that he might be present at this
council‚ whereof we are treating. So that at least four apostles
appeared there, Peter, J ames, John, and Paul, besides those apos-
tolic preachers, Barnabas, J udas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, of
whom we find mention, Acts xv. 223 as also Titus, as appearS,
Gal. ii. 2, and other famous men, of whom consisted the church at
Jerusalem3 so that there never was a more eminent convention
than this, unless when the apostles were all presenff’ Thus Cur-
cellaeus. Others conceive all the twelve apostles were here actu--
ally present, and that the distribution of the provinces of the world,
which the ancients speak of, was made afterwards amongst the
apostles, when the Gentiles all abroad began to fiock into the
church.

ΑΜΖ elder-s. Who arc elsewhere called bishops. Presbyters (or
elders) and bishops were then the same3 see what is said before on
verse the second. But in this council‚ besides the apostles and
presbyters of Jerusalem, there were present other members of the
church‚ viz„ mere brethren, as we find afterwards, ver. 22 and 23.

7. And when there had been much, dispectiny. On both sides.

Peter rose up. To make an oration to the synod.

And said to them. That is, to all the Christians, of what calling
or condition soever, that were present in the synod.

Men, brethren. So Peter calls not only the apostles and elders,
