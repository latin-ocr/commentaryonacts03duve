in us. For, as saith St. Bernard, immersion is a representation of
death and burial.’' But to substitute in the room of immersion,
either sprinkling, or any other way of applying water to the body,
to signify the same thing, is not in the power of the dispensers of
God’s lnysteries, or of the church. For that, as Tho. Aquinas
excellently well observes, ‘⁶ It belongs to the signifier to determine
what sign is to be used for the signification3 but God it is, who
by things sensible signifies spiritual things in the sacraments.”
The church has no more power than was derived to it from the
apostles. Now the apostles were endued by Christ after his
resurrection with authority to preach throughout all nations the
observance of all his pmcepts, Matt. xxviii. 20. But never was
there any power granted to them to change the least tittle in any
of the commands of Christ, much less of adding any new by their
own authority.

Lastly. There is another thing that evinces the necessity of
plunging the parties to be baptized, for that St. Peter asserts,
1 Pet. iii. 20, 21, the genuine end of baptism was not to represent
the inward washing away from sin, which may be represented by
any exterior washing of the body, but to express the death and
resurrection of Christ, as also our own, and our belief of both
resurrections, as the most famous Sir Norton Knatchbull, in his
learned N otes, printed at Oxford, A.D. 1677, with the licenee of
the vice-chaneellor, observes upon that place of Peter, whose
words, though long, I cannot but transcribe, they are so full of
truth and weight. “The sense and meaning of Peter is,” saith
he, “that baptism, which now saves us by water, that is, by the
assistance of water, and is anti-typical to the ark of N oah, does
not signify the laying down of the filth of the fiesh in the water,
but the eovenant of a good conscience toward God, while we are
plunged in the water, which is the true use of water in baptism,
thereby to testify our belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ3
so that there is a manifest antithesis between these words by water,
and by the resurrection, nor is the elegancy of it displeasing. As if
he should say, the ark of Noah, not the flood, was the type of
baptism, and baptism was an anti-type of the ark 3 not as baptism
is a washing away of the filth of the flesh by water, wherein it
answers not at all to the ark3 but as it is the covenant of a good
conscience toward God by the resurrection of Christ, in the belief
of which resurrection we are saved, as they were saved in the ark
