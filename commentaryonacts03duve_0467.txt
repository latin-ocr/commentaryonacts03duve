son to Mammaeus, was also born there, in which place he calls this
same city Arcas in the plural number. But Actipus is derived
from the Hebrew Kepitha, which was a part of the city Acho, as
appears by the Jerusalem Talmud, in the treatise entitled She-
muoth‚ cap. 6, where you will meet with these following words :—
“Rabbi (that is, Jehuda Hanasi, or the prince of the great San-
hedrim, whom by way of excellency they call Rabbi without any
additament,) was in Acho, and there he saw a certain man ascend
from Kepitha.’' Hence J osephus formed Actipus, which is changed
by Ptolemy and Pliny unto Ecdippa.1 It is true that the same
Pliny mentioneth Ace and Ecdippa as two distinct cities, and
Ptolemy Ecdippa, and Ptolemais, and Arca, as different cities of
Phoenicia. But in this case more credit is to be given to «Iosephus,
who affirms that Arce, Actipus, and Ptolemais, are one and the
same city, in the portion of the tribe of Asher or Asser. Bo·-
chartus saith of the same city,—“ The N eoterics call it Acre,
which is most known: therefore it is read in Benjamin, ‘From
Tyre it is a day’s journey to Acre‚' which is Accho, not to Aede,
as vulgarly.’' In 3 Mace. chap. the last, towards the close, it is
called Ptolemais the Rosary, from the nature of the place.

extant above, ch. xiii. 13. See our commentary there.

lee evccnqelist. That is, the preacher of the gospel. They are
called evangelists in the New Testament, who having been set
over no particular church, assisted the apostles in spreading the
gospel of Christ. But in succeeding times it grew out of use, so
that they were only called evangeliste who committed the life and
doctrine of Christ to writing. And of those four penmen of the
gospel, John is in a peculiar manner surnamed the evangelist, to
distinguish him from John the Baptist.
