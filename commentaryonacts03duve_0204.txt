long circumlocutions, that he might lenify them as wild beasts.
But it is very probable that their rage was stirred up when he
shewed them that they had grievously corrupted the law, that
their temple was polluted with superstitious, and that there was
nothing that remained pure among them, by reason that they,
resting in bare types, did not worship God spiritually3 because
they did not refer their ceremonies to the heavenly type. But
although Stephen did not immediately go about to vindicate
himself, but did endeavour by degrees to soften their fierce spirits3
yet he spoke very pertinently to purge himself of the crime they
irnpeached him for. These were the two principal heads of his
accusation: that he had spoken blasphemy against God and his
temple3 that- he had endeavoured to abrogate the law. Stephen,
that he might dissolve these calumnies, beginning his discourse
from the calling of Abraham, showeth that the Jews had no
advantage of the Gentiles by nature, by proper right, or by merits
for their works3 but only by free gift, to wit, because God had
adopted them in the person of Abraham. It makes likewise very

are reckoned the people of God, but only because God of his own
good pleasure chose an unworthy people to himself, and did not
cease to do good to them, though ungratesul. By this means
their high and proud spirits might have been subdued, and reduced
to humility, that being stripped of their foolish pride they were
puffed up with, they might come to the Mediator. Thirdly, he
showed that an angel was praeses in'giving out the law, and that
Moses did so discharge his office, that he said other prophets should
arise after him: yet of whom of necessity there was to be some
chief and prince, who should put an end to all their prophecies
and predictions, and bring them to a full siccomplishment. W hence
it is collected that they werenot at all Mosesâ€™ disciples, who did
reject that doctrine that was promised, and held forth in the law,
