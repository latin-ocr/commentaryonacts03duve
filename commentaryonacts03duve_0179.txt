So that they cast out tlzez‘r young( children. As if he had said, So
that they were forced to expose their young children that were
males to the raging waters. “The wicked king,” saith Usher,
‘⁶ after he had in vain commanded Shiphrah and Puah, the Hebrew
midwives, to make away the male infants privately, published an
inhuman decree to drown them in the river, Exod. i. 15—-22, in
the time that intervened betwixt the birth of Aaron and Moses.'’

Eusebius, lib. ix. Prepar. Evang. have made mention of, in his
tragedy of Moses, published in Greek and Latin by F rid. BIorellus
at Paris, 1609, hath excellently expressed the import of this verse

forth Moses to Amram his nephew, her husband. For Moses was
eighty years of age when he spoke to Pharaoh to let the Israelites
go out of Egypt, Exod. vii. 7, and forty years after their outgoing,
when he died in the l2th month, he was a hundred and twenty
years of age, Dent. xxxi. 23 xxxiv. 7.''
