For the hope of Israel. That is, for the Messiah, who is hoped
for and desired by the Israelites. As if he had said, Because I
teach and bear witness, that he who is hoped for by the people of
Israel hath been already exhibited, when J esus of Nazareth was
exhibited, whom with all asseveration I affirm to be that Messiah
who is promised in the law and the prophets, and who is desirously
looked for by the Israelites, I am bound and fastened with this
chain which ye see, as if Ι had been a wicked and fiagitious fellow.
Christ J esus, 1 Tim. i. 1, is called our hope, because we hope
through his merits to obtain the free gift of eternal life. See also
Col. i. 27. See above, ch. xxvi. 6, 7. “ Paul‚” saith Wolzogenius,

thee to us by those Jews who dwell at Jerusalem, nor hath any of
them who are come hither to Rome accused thee to us.

22. Bac we desire. Greek, ἀξιοῦμεν, “we vouchsafe.” That is,
we do not refuse when we shall have leisure. ·

To hear of thee what thou thinhest. That is, what thou canst bring
in defence of thy opinion about J esus of Nazareth.

For as concor-nimy this sec-t. To wit, that professeth that Jesus
of Nazareth is the Messiah promised in the law and the prophets.

We know that everywhere it is spoken aqainst. To wit, because of
the crimes that are laid to the charge of the same heresy or sect of
the Nazarenes, as they call it, by letters sent from the Sanhedrim
to the synagogues of the Jews that are dispersed through the
several countries of the world, a little after Christ's departure from
