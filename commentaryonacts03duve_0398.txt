rook‚” “a hillock ;” for Mars being here accused of murder before
twelve gods, was absolved by six sentences. The judges of this
court were upright and uncorrupt3 whence these sayings, ‘⁶ More
severe than an Areopagite3 and more silent than an Areopagite.”
Cicero ει “ The affairs of Rome stand thus: nothing more severe,
nothing more constant, nothing more strong than the senate, which
is like Areopagus of Athens.’'

May we know. As much as to say, Go on now; if you please‚

ΥΘ men qs Athens. So their own orators, such as Demosthenes
and AEschines‚ use to call them.

I perceive that in all tlzz'nqs y& are 2⁴00 superstitious, Erasinus hath
noted that in this (liscourse Paul showed admirable policy and pru-
dence. Whose words seeing they greatly illustrate this place, we
shall not think it a trouble to insert them. ‘⁶ The apostlc,'’ saith
he, ⁶< preaohing the gospel at Athens had to do with men of
