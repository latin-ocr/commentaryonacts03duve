that befell the Jews in Galilee and J udea, which use first to por-
tend, and then to bring a people's utter destruction. See what
we have already said upon Joel ii. 30.

lee yreat day ‘ff tlte Lord. That is, the great and terrible
judgment of God upon the refractory Jews. “ In the first sense,”
saith Brenius, “Joel spake this of the destruction by Nebuchad·-
nezzar, but mystically of the destruction by the Romans 3 which is
called by way of super-eminency the day of the Lord.'' Thus also
saith Beza, ‘⁶ These things I refer to the nation of the Jews, whose
utter destruction being shortly to fall upon the obstinate con·-
temners of the gospel is foretold, as Christ also positively declares,
Matt. xxiv.; however, joining them with that last day, when the
same calamity which fornoerly befell Jerusalem, shall be the ruin of
the whole world, guilty of the same great and outrageous obsti-
nacy.” Moreover the destruction of the «Jews by the Romans is
called the great and terrible day of tlte Lorcl, as Lightfoot observes
in his annotations upon Mark ix. l : “It is described as the end
of the world. By PeriPhrasis it is called the last days, or latter
times3 that is, the last times of the continuance of this city and
government. From that time begins the new world. It is also
described as the coming of Christ. His coming in the clouds in
glory with the angels3 and then again as the enthroning of Christ
and his twelve apostles judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” Thus

And not able. In the Greek is epiphanes, by which word the Sep-
tuagint used to render the Hebrew word mmor-a, that signifies
“terrible.” “Nor is it to bc questioned,” saith Ludovicus de
Dieu, “ but that from thence that cruel tyrant Antiochus was called
Epiphanes, “terrible, rather than illustrious.” This Antiochus is
called by Polybius, EpimaneS, that is to say, “ furious,” or ‘⁶ raging
mad.'’

21. And it shall come to pass, that all, &c. As if he had said,
that whosoever shall in word and deed religiously worship Christ
sent by God, shall be delivered from the grievous calainity pre-
pared for the Jews. Thus Paul adapts this prophecy to Christ
