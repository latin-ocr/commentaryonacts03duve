blood, whereof we are forbidden to eat, into a food. For informa-
tion hath arrived at our ears, that stuffing blood into guts, as in
bags, they presume to eat the same as usual meat3 which our
Imperial lvlajesty judging not fit to be tolerated, nor enduring that
both the divine precepts and the honour of our cominonwealth
should be violated by such an ungodly invention of men, whose
whole devotion is for their belly, doth hereby ordain and command,
that no person shall dare practise that wickedness in any kind
either for his own use, or to defile others by selling them such
detestable food. And let him know, whoever he be that shall
henceforth be found to contemn the divine command, and convert
blood into food, whether buyer or seller, he shall forfeit all his goods3

from the defilements of idols and fornication, and what- is strangled

mands according to the letter belonging to every Christian, that he
eat not what dies of itself, whether of bird, or beasts, to wit,
where their blood is not poured forth, which the Apostle's epistle
sent from Jerusalem necessarily requires. Nor what is taken and
killed by any beast, for that too is likewise strangled: and from
blood, that is, not to eat it with the blood: if therefore these things
were written to such as came over from heathenism as the very
rudiments of faith, and were sufficient as to the salvation of those
who by inveterate custom had wallowed in impiety and unbelief,
with what face can any think light of transgressing them? Espe-
