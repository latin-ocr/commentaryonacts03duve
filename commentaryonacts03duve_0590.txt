appeared to thee in an august appearance and full of majesty, as a
judge sitting in an exalted throne, Isa. vi. 6. But these are the
words, saith Piscator, of one highly provoked. He does not say,
“to my people ;’' but he accounteth them strangers, because they
had estranged themselves.

And say. Not solicitous how the hearers will entertain thy dis-
course‚ only do thou discharge thy messa-ge faithfully, committing

expressed by imperatives, “ In hearing hear ye and understand not,
and in seeing see ye and perceive not.” On which place of Isaiah
excellent is that of Hen. Moller, Pat. Hamburg: ⁴⁶ It is not com-
manded that they should stop their ears in the assembly, or that all
their senses should, of their own accord, be stupefied, but it is a most
sad complaint, which is expressed after the manner of men with a
kind of indignation and imprecation. As if he had said, Continue,
