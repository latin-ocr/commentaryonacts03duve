men, Rabbi Eliezer expressly contradicts Rabbi Joshua, who was
the first that I know of who asserted this sort of baptism among the
Jews. For Rabbi Eliezer, who was contemporary with Rabbi
J oshua, if he did not live before him, asserts that a proselyte cir-
cumcised and not baptized, was a true proselyte, for so we read of
the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that they were circum-
cised, but not baptized. But Rabbi J oshua affirms, that he who
was baptized, not he who was circumcised, was a true proselyte.
To whom shall I give credit? To Eliezer, who asserts what
the scripture confirms, or to Joshua, who affirms what is nowhere
to be found in scripture? But the rabbins upheld Joshua‘s side,
and what wonder was it? for it made for their business, that is,
for the honour of the Jewish religion, that the Christians should
borrow their ceremonies from them. But when I see men of
great learning in these times fetching the foundations of truth
from the rabbins, Ι cannot but hesitate a little. For whence was
the Talmud sent us? (They are the words of Buxtorf, in his
Synagoga Judaica,) ‘ that we should give so much credit thereto,
that from thence we should believe that the law of Moses either
can or ought to be understood ⁴? ⁷ Much less the gospel‚ to which
they were professed enemies. For the Talmud is called a ‘laby-
rinth of errors, and the foundation of Jewish fables.’ It was
brought to perfection, and held for authentic five hundred years
after Christ3 therefore it is unreasonable to rest upon the testimony
of it. And that which moves me most, JosephuS, (to omit all the
fathers that lived before the Talmud was finished) who was also a
J ew, and contemporary with Rabbi Eliezer, who also wrote in
particular of the rites‚ customs, and acts of the Jews, is altogether
silent in this matter3 so that it is an argument to me next to a.
demonstration, that two such eminent persons, both Jews, and
living at the same time, the one should positively deny, the other
make no mention of baptism among the Jews. Resides, if baptism
in the modern sense, were in use among the Jews in ancient
times, why did the Pharisecs ask John Baptist, Wzy dost thou
’ baptizo, zf thou αντ not Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet? John i.
25. Do they not plainly intimate that baptism was not in use
before, and that it was a received opinion among them, that there
should be no baptism, till either Christ, or Elias, or that prophet
came. How then there should be so much affinity between bap-
tism and the divings of the JeWS, that the one should be suc—
