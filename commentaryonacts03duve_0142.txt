122 THE ACTS or THE HOLY ArosrLEs [CHAP. v·

36. For before these days rose up Theudas. Theudas is not a
Greek, but the Hebrew name rr-nn, which the Syrians pronounce
by a dipthong leeuda, as they call Thomas, Thaumas, and J oseph‚
Jauseplz, as Grotius noted. ‘⁶ Luke,'’ saith Henry Valesius,1 “or
rather Gamaliel in Luke, saith expressly that Theudas rose up but
very lately, yea, in these same days wherein he spake. For before
these days rose up leeudas, which words demonstrate the thing to have
been done very lately, for so both Greeks and Latins use to speak
of a thing lately fallen out, as may be proved by many instanceS.
For before these dayS, then, is as much as in these days, for the
Greeks and Latins say, before ihe third day of, the kalends, for the
third day of the kalends. Wherefove when Luke subjoins, after
this man rose up Judas, nothing else is meant by it than that
Theudas was older than J udas the Galilean. Which gloss,
though at first it seems somewhat hard, yet it is altogether
necessary, and most true, neither does it want exaniples, for as
often as we reckon from the last, which is nearer us, we must
make the first last, and the last first. For that reason Tertullian‚
in his Apologetic, hath used the word reim), to say “a good while
ago,” in times past3 and retrosior, for “ancienterj’ and nevertheless
rem) in Latin is the same as post, “afterward.”

“But because Casaubon denies that ever the Greeks spake so,
we produce a witness beyond all exception, which is Clemens
Alexandrinus,‘2 who speaks in the very same manner that Luke
does3 for having observed almost all the heretics to have broken
out about the time of Hadiian, and to have come even to the
reign of Antoninus Pius, as Basilides and Valentine, he subjoins,
‘for Marcion lived about the same time with Basilides and Valen-
tine, but he, as the elder, was conversing with them, being yet
young.’ He adds then, ‘After whom, Simon for a while heard
Peter preach.’ W ho sees not in this place of Clemens, that ‘after
whom,’ is the same with ‘before whom ἴθ’ For neither was Simon
the Sorcerer after hlarcion, but rather lived long before him, as is
constant among all. But certainly Clemens, while he makes a
catalogue of heretics, reckoned them first who were the last, and
put Simon the last of all. But also geographers describing the
situation of lands and names of people, speak after the same
manner: for they say, after these are those, that is, above these
