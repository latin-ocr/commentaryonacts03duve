greater heat thereof both the bodies of those that did swim out of
the waters might be warmed and their wet clothes dried.

A viper. This poisonous and noisome kind of serpent is so called
because it brings forth by violence, as it were, or rather, for that it
bringstorth young ones alive, for the viper's travail is therefore
the harder, because she brings forth living, or quick brood, while
other serpents lay cggs only.

And cominy out qs tlte heat. It is very well known that vipers,
and other such like sei-pents, used to leap violently out of bushes
and twigs. Hence, in Palladius’s Lausiakes, cap. 20, Macarius,
digging a well, was bitten by an asp, nigh the rushes and shrubs
or twigs that lay there. And Lucian, in his Philopseudes, gives
us account that Midas, the vine-dresser, lay dead after he was
bitten by a viper. ‘⁶ For while he was a tying' the vine-branches,
and supporting them with forks,” says he, “a beast creeping out
from thence, did sting the great toe of his foot.’' Thuanus, de
Vita sua, lib. iii.: “WVhen we came the next morning from the
church, every one approaching in all haste to the fire, not
thoroughly kindled. as yet, there leapt a serpent out of a bundle,
moist either by reason of the rain or the low cellar whence it was
brought, and after its being exposed to open view, we had well con-
sidered it, we thought it like an amphisbaena, a serpent which had
a head on both ends, and goeth both ways. In like manner Paul’s
viper broke out of the twigs, neither did she assail him while he
was gathering the sticks, being then benumbed. with cold, for it
was winter.” Hence Prudentius, in the preface of his first book
against Symmachus, ver. 28 :—

While Paul of twigs an heap did make,
To dissipate the cold,
He to the fire the shrubs did take,
To cause the flame wax bold.
He carelessly his hand did set,
Into the heap of wood ;
In which a viper eold, did get
A place for hem abode.

But when Paul cast the twigs or sticks, in which the viper did
lurk, into the fire, she, being either refreshed by a gentle heat or
exasperated by the excess thereos, assailed Paul. Thus Phaedrus,
lib. iv. fal. 18.

One having brought a frozen snake to life,

By hcat's approach ; he made hiinsclfa knise,
'so cut his throat. For when the heat she smest,
Her poisonous smart the patient soul soon sclt.
