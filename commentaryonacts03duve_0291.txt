had only one chain tied to his right hand, which was also tied to
the left hand of the soldier, who had the charge of guarding him,
as may be seen in Pliny, lib. x. Ep. 30 3 Seneca, Ep. 5. 3 et lib.
de Tranquil. cap. x, Augustino also seems to hint the same
thing upon the 118th Psahn: ‘⁶ Two are bound and sent to the
judge, a thies, and one bound with him, one of them a wicked per-
son and the other innocent, both of them tied with one chain, but
yet far enough from one another.'’ For the chain was of such a
length as did not hinder their convenient passing along, “and
that there should be no pain, and no danger of the prisoners
escaping,'’ as the Theodosian Codex phrases it.

And tlze keepers before tlze door kept tlte prison. Here is described
the diligent efforts of Peter’s enemies to keep him securely, that

because, that by reason of their shortness, they did not keep out
the dust.

Cast thy yar-ment about thee. That is, thy outward garment‚ as
those do who are going abroad.

9. He wz'st not, &c. As if he should say, he believed all this to
be but a dream, because so unlooked for a deliverance did exceed

the Grecians free-men, and only liable to their own laws: ‘⁶ then
the people,'' saith Livy, lib. 33, “heard the herald’s voice, their joy
