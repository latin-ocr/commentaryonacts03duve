abroad that she lay carnally with her brother german Agrippa,
she advised Polemon king of Cilicia, that he would first be circum-

especially induced thereto by her riches, yet that marriage was
not of long continuance, by reason of intemperance, as it is said,
Berniee departing from him, who presently after he was deserted

answer subjoined to it. “Δῖκη,” saith Ribera on Hos. xiii„ “ is a
law-term, and signifieth a cause which is pleaded before the judge,
and decree of the judge, and right or an action to do or ask any
thing, and the punishment which is inflicted, which also the Latins
sometimes call (lica using a Greek word for one of their own.''

pound καταδίκην, which signifies “condemnation.”
