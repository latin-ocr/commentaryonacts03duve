8 'mn Ac‘rs or 'rflss nom APOSTLEs [cHAP. 1.

in an assembly of five hundred of the brethren, 1 Cor. xv. 6, upon
the mountain of Galilee, according to his own appointment,
finding his disciples not willing to return to Jerusalem still as
it were reeking with his blood without his express order, he com-
manded them to repair thither forthwith, and not to stir from
thence, until they had received the Holy Ghost according to his
promise.

They should wait for the promise of the Father. Thus he calls,
both here and Luke xxiv. 49, the gift of the Holy Ghost promised
by the Father to all believers, Isa. xliv. 3 3 Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 273
and Joel ii. 28. -

Which, saith he, με have heard from my mouth. As if he had
said: the performance of which promise I have told you that I
will make good to you, Luke xxiv. 49. A passing like to this,
from an oblique to a direct speech, is frequent in history.

5. Because Jolm, διο. As if he had said, Because within a few
days ye shall find by experienee, how truly my forerunner John
said formerly that he baptized indeed with water, but that I would
baptize with the Holy ¹host. See our litei-al explication on
Matt. iii. 11.

Shall be baptized. The Greek word βαπτίζειν, says Casaubon,
is to dip or plunge, as if it were to dye colour. In which sense
the apostles may be truly said to have been baptized. For the
house in which this was done was filled with the Holy Ghost‚
So that the apostles may seem to have been plunged into it, as
into a large fish-pond. Hence OEeumenius, upon Acts ii. 2: ‘⁶ A
wind filled the whole house, that it seemed like a fish—pond3
because it was promised to the apostles, that they should be bapr
tized with the Holy Ghost.”

Not many days hence. Christ seems as it were to point out
with his finger those few days between the time whereiu he had
charged his disciples not to stir out of Jerusalem, and the approach-
ing· Pentecost.

6. When they therefore were all mel. That is, all the apostles at
Jerusalem.

They ashed him. WVhen he appeared to them upon the very day
of his ascent into heaven, as appears out of the 1 Cor. xv. 73
Luke xxiv. 50, 51, compared together.

Wilt thou at this time restore ayain the hinydom of Israel ζ) That
is, Now thou art again risen from the (lead, wilt thou reign over
