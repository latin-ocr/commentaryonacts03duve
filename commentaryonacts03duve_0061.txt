the Romans, in regard of the common league of friendship be-
tween both nafions, perniitted them to live under their own laws,
but that the Cappadocians, sending their ambassadors, refused
their liberty, and desired to have a king imposed upon thern.
The Romans, therefore, admiring the humour of the people‚ that
[they] were out of love with liberty, sent them a free permission to
choose a king among themselves, who thereupon chose Ario-
barzanes, whom Porphyrogenitus calls Ariaratha3 whose line
failing also after the third descent, Archelaus was imposed upon
them by Antonius, no way related to Ariobarzanes. Formerly

Amasia.

Halys, to the east by the country of Colchis, to the south by the
lesser Armenia, and to the north by the Euxine sea, according to
Strabo. Ptolemy, varying in his limits: “Pontus,” saith he,' “is
bounded to the west by the mouth of the Propontis and the
Thracian Bosphorus, to the south by that country which is pro-

Asia. Meaning the Proconsular Asia, which was under the
proconsul, and chief of the seven provinces which constituted
the Asian diocese.² ‘⁶ The Romans,'’ saith Fredcrick Spanheim
the son, “called that particularly Asia which comprehended the
country belonging to thc Pergamen kings, which lies between the
