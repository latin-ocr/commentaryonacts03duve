6. And lte tremblz'ny and astonishecl, &c. As much as to say, But
Saul being terrified with the brightness of the heavenly light, and
the voice which came from heaven, puts off his wolf-like fierceness,
and puts on a sheep-like disposition, and also freely and willingly
gives himself to do the commands of the great Shepherd of souls,
whom he lately despised. For the Lord J esus sends him to the
city of Damascus, that he might there be taught of him what he
himself would have him do, to whom he should commit that
charge from heaven.

7. And the men which journeyed with lzz‘m. That is, they who
were Paul's companions in his journey to Damascus,

Stood speeeclzless. That is, being astonished at the strangeness of
this admirable thing, they stood unmoved, or, that I may use
Virgil’s phrase, “they stuck immoveable to the ground.” To
stand, here denotes not a posture of the body, but a mere staying,
and is opposed to going forward, not to lying prostrate, seeing
below, ch. xxvi. 14, that Paul's companions fell upon the earth.
So Gen. xix. 17: Nez'tlzer stay thou in all the plain, that is, do not
tarry nor delay. Lev. xiii. 37: If tlte scall be at α stay, that is,
spread no farther.

Heariny α voice. To wit, sent from heaven, which beat upon
their ears, although, as it is said below, ch. xxii. 9, they understood
not the meaning and signification of the words: either because they
were not skilful in the Hebrew dialect, wherein Christ spake to
Saul, as may be seen below, ch. xxvi. 14, or, because they indeed
heard the sound of the voice, but, in the meantime, did not exactly
take up the words of that sound. “They heard,” saith famous
Lightfoot, ‘⁶ 5517, ‘a voice,’ but they heard not Ἶ-ζ-ῑῖῐ, a ‘word.'” The
like happened, John xii. 29. Therefore “to hear,” below, ch. xxii. 9,
is put for “to understand,” as Gen. xi. 73 xlii. 233 Deut. xxviii. 493
2 Kings xviii. 263 Isaiah xxxvi. 113 Jer. v. 153 1 Cor. xiv. 2, 21.

But seeinq no man. Although they lifted up their eyes to heaven,
whence the voice came, that they might see who spake to Saul.
‘⁶ This,” saith Beza, “is the force of the word θεωρεῖν 111 this place.
For otherwise it were no wonder that they saw none, who being
struck with fear, durst not lift up their eyes.” Saul only saw Him

who spake to him, as Dan. x. 7.
8. And Saul arose from the earth. The Greek hath it, ‘⁶ He was

raised up‚'' as Daniel was, Dan. viii. 18.
And when Itis eyes were opened, lle saw 720 man. That is, his eye-
