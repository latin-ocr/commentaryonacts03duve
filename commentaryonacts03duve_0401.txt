he touches him. No mention of the divine nature 3 also as to the
cross which was foolishness to the nations, silence. He calls him
only a man, whom God hath set out in this world, that the truth
being by him cleared, the penitent should be freely pardoned, and
the unbelieving being now inexcusable should be justly punished.
N either does he adduce the testimonies of the prophets here3 but
only with one argument proves what he said, because God raised
him from the dead. Only at the mentioning of the resurrection
some mooked, others being more modest, said, We will hear thee
again of this matter. He who desireth to be more fully taught,
hath profited in some measure. Here also it seems the apostle’s
discourse was interrupted, his auditors leaving him, neither would
he press them any further: ‘But departed from among them,’
saith Luke, waiting a more fit occasion. Also this same happened
by Paul’s wisdom, that he was neither misused, nor railed at, nor
hurt by any seizing upon him, but departed safe3 but not without
gain. Them who cleaved to him he more fully instructed, among
which were Dionysius, and a certain woman named Damaris, and
others with them. Hence it appears how great force a discourse
tempered with prudent meekness hath.''

Superstitiozcs. The Greek hath it “ too superstitious.'' ‘⁶ They are
called superstitious,'' saith Lactantius,1 ‘⁶ who worship the surviving
memory of the deceased, or who, surviving their parents, honour
their images as household gods. For they called them superstitious
who assumed to themselves new rites, that they might, instead of
gods, honour the dead, whom they thought were from nien received
into heaven: but them who worshipped the public and ancient
gods, they called religious.’' Virg. AEn. viii. ver. 187.

Foolz'slz superstition, which lmoweth not tlte ancient θοάς. “Butss’
saith Lactantius further, ‘⁶ seeing we find also the old gods, in the
same manner consecrated after death, they are therefore super-
stitious who worship many and false gods. But we are religious,
who supplicate one and the true God.” Servius upon the forecited
[place] out of VirgiLQ Evander's words to AEneas: “ Superstition,”
saith he, “is a foolish and superfluous fear, or it is denominated
from little old women, who surviving many, dote for age, and
become fools.'’ Or, according to Lucretius, superstition is a vain
and superfluous fear of divine and heavenly things which are
above us.
