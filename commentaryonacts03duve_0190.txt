betwixt the angel that spoke to him in Mount Sina, and our
fathers who stayed at the bottom of the same mountain. See
Exod. xix. “That which is immediately subjoined,'' saith Beza,
‘⁶ about his conferring with the angel in mount Sina, and receiving
the tables of the law, doth manifestly seem to denote a certain
special convention of the people, to wit, that history which is
mentioned in Exodus, from chap. xix. to XXXV.’⁷

lslh'th the anqel which spake to him. In God's name, and by his
special appointment. ‹Iosephus saith, 1 ‘⁶ Seeing we have received
our principal tenets, and the most holy part of our laws from God
by angels.” The law was given by angels, -by the ministry of a
Truch-man, to wit, hloses, that it might be of force until the
promised Seed should come, Gal. iii. 19. And the writer to the
Hebrews prefers the gospel to the law in this, that the gospel was

“ In which place,” saith Grotius, ‘⁶ they are called angels, with a
number denoting a multitude, whereas Stephen only said angel,
because such is the custorn of those visions, that one angel sustains

as also other angels who were sent about matters of great
concern do speak. Even after the same manner as heralcls (lo
proclaim the judge’s words, as saith Augustine, 2 Trin. 2, and 111
like sort they suffer themselves to be addressed3 so hloses saith
that God, Jehovah‚ spoke to him in the bush, Exod. iii. 14, and he
that spoke called himself ΠζΠιξζ ἾῚ-Ὶξιὶξ, which is an explication of the
word ΠᾏΠζ. But Stephon saith that the angel of the Lord was seen
by Moses in the burning of the bush, and that by the authority of
B'Ioses himself, Exod. iii„ 2.’'

Who received the lively oracles. That is, he received from God
the doctrine of life and salvation, to deliver it to us3 nor did hc

our fathers, not so much rebellious against 1110666 as against God
himself in his person, ‘⁶ turned their minds to the profane rites of
the Egyptians,'' as Lactantius expresseth it, Instit. lib. iv„ c. 10.
That the worshipping of beasts obtained in Egypt long ago, and
