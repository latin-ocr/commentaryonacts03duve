knee, or less, which being filled with water, it was easy to descend
into them. And he caused curtains to be hanged about the hogs-
heads upon small pillars set up, and cords put into them, that each
hogshead might be enclosed all about with a veil in manner of a
circle: but a linen cloth did hang upon a cord put through it,
before the priests, and his fellow ministers, who stood on the one
hand, to administer the sacrament, that so all things being very
modest on every side, there might not be any thing censured as
folly or filthiness in the sacrament, lest the honester sort of persons
should withdraw themselves from the sacrament of baptism for
shame’ sake.” The author proceeds, and declareth the thing yet
more clearly in this manner. “ When therefore all did come to be
catechized, the bishop speaking unto them all, commonly with a
speech that did agree to such, and setting one sex over against
another, on the right hand, and on the left, anointed the catechizet]
with oil: afterward biddeth them go from the font. Therefore they
coming unto the entrance of the curtain, they one by one only did
enter in with their godfathers, and presently the godfathers did

manded the person that was baptized, to come out of the water,
his godfathers covering, and putting on him the garment which
they did hold. N either did the diligence of Otho in the winter
time, neglect to find out what was most convenient for the season,
to wit, he celebrated the sacrament of baptism in warm baths and
in hot water with the same neatness and observation of modesty,
with the hogsheads set into the earth, and curtains applied, frankin-
cense, and other odoriferous spices sprinkling all things.” This
most accurate diligence of Saint Otho proveth, that the prudence
of those men was contrary unto all good order, who after a thou·
sand and three hundred years after Christ, did change baptism,
that is, dipping, appointed by Christ, into rhantism, that is, sprink-
