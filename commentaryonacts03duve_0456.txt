extended to every part of managing the flock, such as to lead,
defend, rule, and direct them. ‘⁶ The care of the church is equally
divided among many,” saith J erome. For as he saith, “Before that
by the instigation of the devil, there were parties made in religion,
and it was said among the people, I am of Paul, I oprollos, but
J am os Cophos, the churches were governed by the common advice
of presbyters.” Those spiritual pastors set up by God to feed not
their own fiock, but the fiock of their Lord and Supreme Pastor,
ought to consult the good of the flock, and procure their salvati0n2
feeding the people with divine oracles and healthful admonitions,

doctrine of Christ. Behold here, as also Phil. i. 1 3 the church is

Son Jcsus Christ. Hence saith Beza it is read in one Greek copy,
‘⁶ By this blood, of this his own,’' viz., Son. “ The strength of that
article,” saith Beza, “is to be observed‚ whereby the excellency of
this blood, and the antithesis is declared, which is more copiously
expounded, Heb. ix. 12. For this blood was truly holy, yea, a
