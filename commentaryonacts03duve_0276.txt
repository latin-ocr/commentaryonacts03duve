To hear all tlzz'nJS, Sco. Cornelius prudently distinguishes
betwixt God and nian, for he makes God the author of the
commandments, but allows man no more but the ministry and
embassy. ‘⁶ Thou shalt find US‚’⁷ saith 116, “ attentive and obedient
disciples 10 all those things God has commanded us by thee: so
that 116 alone shall have 1116 command, thou shalt 116 only his
minister: he alone shall speak, 11111 from thy 111011111.” And God
prescribes this to all his servants, in the person of Ezekiel, Ezek.
xxxiii. 7: And tleou, O son qs man, I leave set thee α wateleman moto
the house ‘ff Israel: therefore thou skalt hear the word at my mouth,
ancl warn them from me.

34. But Peter openivy his mouth. It is an emphatical phrase,
which is wont 10 116 used, when one, after a long silence, begins 10
speak, as Job. iii. 13 and of any matter of singular moment, as Psa.
lxxviii. 23 Prov. viii. 63 Matt. v. 23 xiii. 353 and that with an
eager vehemence, with an ardour and emotion both of mind and
voice, as Judg. xi. 353 Job xxxiii. 23 Psa. xlix. 4. Thus the
apostle would have the Ephesians by prayer to entreat God, ‘that
utterance might 116 given him, that 116 might open his mouth,
Eph. vi.·19, where the words ἐν ἀνοίξει τοῦ στόματος, by way of
explication, are exponnded in the following phrase, ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ,
with boldncss.

Of α trum I perceive. That is, what before, being prejudiced,
I (lid not understand. “’Ew' ἀληθείας καταλαμβάνομ(ιι,” saith
Heinsius, “he may say, who being really persuaded, is forced to
change his opinion. Peter was persuaded that it was unlawful for
a Jew 10 converse with Gentiles3 although 1116 Lord in that
vision, which is mentioned ver. ll, and afterwards, endeavoured
to make him forsake this opinion. Now, being by Cornelius's
example, 111016 fully convinced that that was true which was
enigmatically by a vision signified to him, he says that hc is
ἐπ’ ἀληθείας καταλαμβάνεσθαι, which is, ‘conquered by ‘truth,’ or
‘ compelled by 1116 1111111 10 change his opinion.'”

God is 710 respeeter of persons· That is, there is no man whom
God respects for those prerogatives, which may be common as well
10 1116 bad as good. ‘⁶ It is to be observed,'’ saith Ε511115, 011 Rom.
ii. 11, “that this phrase, by which any 0116 15 said to be a respector
of persons, which indeed 15 peculial· to 1116 holy writ, is (16111611
