We ouylzt not to think, &c. As much as to say, None that is in
his right mind should assimilate dead things, to wit, silver, gold,
and stone, to God, though graven with the best art that man can
invent. For silver, gold, and stone, are things far below man, and
art cannot but be more ignoble than the artificer. See Isaiah xl.
183 xliv. 133 xlvi. 5. ‘⁶ Moreover,” saith Beza‚ “we must know

times of ignorance3 either because he composed not a form of
religion for the nations, as hc did for the Israelites, by which they
were to be bounded in his service and worship, neither sent he
any prophets to them to drive away their darkness, but suffered
them to walk in their own ways, as is said above, ch. xiv. 16, or
because he did not then severely punish them, but patiently
suffered them. See Rom. iii. 25.
