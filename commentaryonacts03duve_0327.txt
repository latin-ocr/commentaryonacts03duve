Unto tlze yates. That is, when he brought the oxen crowned
With garlands to the gates of the city where Paul preached, and
the lame man whom he restored did sit, or 'to the door of the
house where Paul and Barnabas lodged. “For this was‚‘' saith
Ludovicus de Dieu, “ the fashion of their houses in all the eastern
countries, that the first door being opened‚ which looked into the
street, you presently come to another covered With a veil, which
the Arabians call ‘ a covering,' lest he that enters, may see into the

mourning of the whole people: that in this case it was lawful for
for him to rend his clothes, is evinced from the example of J ona-
than the high priest, when he was overe-ome in battle, l Mac.
xi. 71. But the most learned among the rabbins say, that the
high priest used to rend his garment from the bottom of it, but the
rest of the Jews from the top.

We are liable to infirmities of the same nature with you to whom
we preach, that casting away all these feigned dcities, with which
the world hath hitherto been deluded, ye may turn to that living
