lay their hands upon the sich, cmcl they shall recover. Now im-
position of hands is a visible sign of prayer, which J ames maketh
mention of, ch. v. 14. Paul therefore conj⁴oined the sign with the
thing signified, that is, imposition of hands with prayer, when he
restored to health Poplius or Publius’s father, who was sick of a
fever and bloody flux. Moreover, every promise that belongs to
the body is conditional, and has the exception included in it,
except God shall see it fitting otherwise for just causeS, although
unknown to us. For not the apostles themselves indeed, although
present, could restore to health all that were sick in the church
after the manner prescribed, James v. 143 as you may sce, Phil.
ii. 26, 27 ; 2 Tim. iv. 20. For hcalth of body sometimes prejudices
that of the mind, and sickness of body sometimes is the means to
attain soundness of mind, and as Seneca of Providence saith, cap.

expresseth it, “calamity is frequently the discipline of virtue.’'
Hence Salvianus, presbyter of Massilia, of God’s Government,
lib. i., ‘⁶ We must not be grieved at the affliction of infirmities,
Which we understand to be the mother of virtues.”

father was restored to health by Paul's prayerS, when he laid on

Came. To Paul, that he might lay his hands upon them, and

implore the help of God for healing them.
And they were healecl. At the prayers of Paul who laid his

hands upon them.
10. Who. Thosc that were recovered froin their sickness.

Honoured us with many honours. As if he had said, having a
grateful remembrance of their miraculous recovery, not only did
they highly honour Paul, at whose praycrs they were freed from
their diseases, but also me Luke, the writer of this history, and the

rest of Paul’s attendance.
And when we sailed. As if he had said, And when we loosed

from the island Malta, to sail further.

They put. Into the ship.
Such thinys as were necessary. That is, large and liberal pro-

vismn.
11. And after three months. Of the winter, elapsed from the
time of our arrival at the island Malta.
