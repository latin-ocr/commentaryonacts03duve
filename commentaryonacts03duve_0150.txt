the fisher, but we make it appear by this infallible proof that we
fight for Christ, because we fight with meekness and humility, as
Christ did.” Salvianus, a presbyter of Marseilles, speaking of the
Arians,¹ whose heresy every orthodox ma'n ahhors: “ They are
heretics,’' says he, ‘⁶ but they do not know it. They are heretics
with us, but with themselves they are not such; for they so far
judge themselves Catholics, that they defame ourselves with the
brand of heretical overthwartedness. What therefore they are to
us, we are the same to them. The truth is, with us, but they pre-
sume it be with themselves. God's honour is with us, but they
think that what they believe is for his honour. They are ungodly,
but this they think to be true godliness. They err, but they err
with a good intention, thinking that they both honour and love
God. Though they have not an orthodox saith, yet they think it
to be a perfect love of God, and how they shall be punished for
this heterodox error in the day of judgment, none can know except

aside, or be carried out of the council, and lest the council should
seem to assemble against them as innocents, and guilty of no crime,
they punished them with that judicial punishment of forty stripes,
enjoined Dent. xxv. 2, 3, which was inflicted upon the disobedient,
and was commonly called by the HebreWS, ‘a striking' The JewS,
by the Romans’ permission, had power to correct their own in
J udea and some neighbouring places, even with strokes.

They commanded, &c. As much as to say, they strictly forbade
them, that they should not henceforth preach the gospcl of Christ,
and that they should speak nothing to any man that tended to
the praise of J esus of Nazareth.

41. And they. To wit, the apostles, were dismissed by the San-
hedrim, after being basely beaten, as Christ foretold, also remem-
bering his command, Matt. x. l7, 21, 35; xxiii. 343 Mark xii. 53
