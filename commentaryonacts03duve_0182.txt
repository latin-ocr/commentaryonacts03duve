23. And when he was full for-ty years old. Bereschith Babba, fol.
115, 001. 3: “Moses lived forty years in Pharaoh's court, and
forty in Midian3 and the same number of years he ministered unto
Israel.” See also Shemoth Babba, fol. 118, col. 3. What Moses
did till he was forty years old, the scripture nowhere declareth.
Josephus reporteth ¹ that he was a general in the Ethiopic war,
and that when he besieged Saba, he married the king's daughter,
by name Tharbis, who was deeply in love with him. Whatever
there be of this war, which Theodoret and others say is fabulous,
there is no doubt but that Moses has omitted many things con-
cerning himself, out of humility. For it is not probable that he
gave himself over to laziness and sluggishness during the forty
years that he lived at court like a prince.

It came into lais heare to visit, &c. As much as to say, By a new
and extraordinary impulse of the Spirit he was moved to visit 1115
brethren the Israelites, whose spirits were broken with the rigour
of their bondage. Philo saith, that Moses used frequently to visit
1115 brethrcn the Israelites that were groaning under their burden,

Solomon, by what authority I know not, affirmeth to have been
the husband of Shelomith the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of
Dan, that is mentioned Lev. xxiv. 11.

Sqffer wrony. That is, wrongfully beaten, Exod. ii. 11. Some
think that this Egyptian who beat the Hebrew was one of the
king's governors, who took account of the Israelites’ work, and
punished those that were slack. The Jews add, that this Egyptian
committed adultery with the wife of that Israelite, who while he
was invcighing against this injury of the Egyptian with words,
had his mouth stopped by the Egyptian with stripes.

He avenyed him. That is, by a just revenge he provided for his
secui-ity. For at that time there was no judge who could redress
thc inj ury, and the injury was urgent and could not admit of delay
of time. Yet many of the ancient fathers, amongst whom
Augustino, lib. xxii„ against Faustus, cap· 20, et seq„ do accuse
Moses of too great zeal and precipitancy. OEcumenius, on the
