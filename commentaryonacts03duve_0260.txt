And sent him forth to Tarsus. A most famous city of Cilicia,
where Saul himself was born, as may be seen below, eh. xxi. 39,
xxii. 4. Of this city Strabo saith, “ Tarsus is situated in a plain3

seeking for Io. The river Cydnus passeth through it to the very
place where young champions exercise their strength. Its springs
not being far distant from it, and its channe} running through a
huge valley, whence presently the river falls into the city, the
river is cold and sharp, whereby it eures both men and cattle that
