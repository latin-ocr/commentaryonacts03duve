afterward betakes himself unto the mercy of God, and com-
mendeth himself to the prayers of the church. These being cer-
tainly not the least signs of penitence, therefore we may conjecture
he did repent; and that, notwithstanding the ancients with one
consent do write that he was a grievous adversary to Peter after-
ward, and that he did dispute with him three days at Rome.
There is a written disputation that goes under the name of
Clement, but which contains such unpleasant dotingS, that it is a
wonder Christian ears can bear it. Afterwards Augustine showeth
unto Januarius, that there were divers and fabulous reports spread
about that matter in his time at Rome: whereforc there is nothing
safer than having renounced uncertain opinions, simply to embrace
what is written in the scripture. What elsewhere we have read
written concerning Simon, may deservedly be suspected for many
causes.'’ Epiphanius counteth it among the heresies of Simon,
that he said the Old Testament was from an evil g0d3 when,

the Holy Spirit upon the apostles; and that Christ neither did come,
nor did suffer any thing by the Jews· Again, others do write
that he did teach that he himself was God, and descended in
Samaria as the Father, and did appear to the Jews as the Son, in
the rest of the nations he did descend as the Holy Ghost. Ignatius

the serpent, that was the prince of wickedness.” J ustin Blartyr
telleth us ¹ that at Rome, in the island of AEsculapius in the river
of Tiber, betwixt the two bridges, that the same Simon was
rewarded with a statue and altar, having this inscription in Latin
letters, “To Simon, the holy God.” Photius says, in his Epist.
xxxviii„ that Simon did carry an image of Christ about him.
Epiphanius, Haer. 21, telleth us, that he brought in the worship
of images. We may see in Bede, in the fifth book of his His-
tory of England, chap. xxviii„ that a certain kind of shaving
was invented by him. From him, says Augustine,³ did come the
