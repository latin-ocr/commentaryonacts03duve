with any such food. In the Roman martyrology, on the eleventh
of March is celebrated the memory of fourscore martyrs in
Campania, who would not eat flesh sacrificed, nor worship the
head of a goat. And since abstinence from eating of blood is by
the apostles in their decree placed in the same degree of necessity
with the avoiding things offered to idols, (of which it were not
lawful for us to cat at this day, if we conversed amongst idolaters),
we may conclude the former likewise ought not to be counted as
only a temporary law, and given to avoid the scandal of the weak3
but to be of perpetual diu-atior), even to the end of the world, and
that, although there were none that by its violation could be
offended.''

Fornication. We take the word in its most usual sense, for the
carnal commixture of a single man with a single woman3 which
commonly amongst the heathens was not looked upon as any sin
or evi13 and therefore there was reason to fear‚ lest some of them

young men should go down thither.” As if it were an argument
of their probity and honesty that they went to those public
brothels, and did not attempt the chastity of other men’s wives, &o
And how much some new converted Christians needed a bridlc
herein, appears by the serious exhortations Paul uses to avoid
whoredom, 1 Cor. vi. 153 1 Thess. iv. 3, 4 3 and elsewhere.

And thz'nys strcmylecl. That is, animals deprived of life, without
letting forth the blood. The learned Curcellaeus makes some
scruple whether this be not an addition to the primitive authentic
