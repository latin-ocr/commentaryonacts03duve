Jesus.” Excellent is that of Calvin, on the now cited place of
Deuteronomy: “ Not without reason would God have the guilty
die by their hands, by whose testimony they were condemned.
Executioners were not made use of among the people of ancient
times, that in punishing the wicked there might be a greater sense
of religion, modesty, and reverence. But God especially committed
this charge to the witnesses, because the tongue of a great many
is precipitant, not to say blabbing, so that they would make no
scruple to kill one with their words, whom they durst not so much
as touch with their finger. It was therefore an excellent expedient
for restraining this lightness, not to receive the testimony of any,
unless 1115 hand were ready to execute judgment.’'

leez'r clothes. To wit, their upper 01· outer garments. Greek,
τᾶ ἱμάτια. Lud. de Dieu, On John xiii. 4, saith, “ Although τὸ ἱμάτιον
in the singular number signifieth sometimes a cloak, yet τὰ ἱμάτια
in the plural number, is not, that Ι know of, used to signify one
cloak. Nor is there any fear of their being naked. For seeing
in those hot countries they made use of most fine stuff, they put
on several garments one upon ⁸another, that the force of the sun-
beams might not easily penetrate them, which yet they easily put
off, when they had occasion so to do. N ext to the body was
mmo, ‘the shirt3' above it mmmm, ‘the breeches3' over it Νόωῦκ,
‘ the robe,’ a garment that hung down to the ankle3 to which was
added mm, ‘the girdle,’ wherewith they girded it, that it might
not hinder them in their walking3 above all these waS, &⁸972 or
mmm, ‘the cloak.’ Suppose then that our Lord laid aside his
eloak and robe, it is rightly expressed in the plural number, τὰ
ἱμάτια, ‘his clothes,’ and yet he was not naked. But also our
Lord is rightly said to have been naked by a phrase usual among
the Eastern nations, where he is said to be naked who hath put off
his robe, although at the same time he hath both his shirt, or inner
coat, and breeches on him. Thus King Saul sang naked before
Samuel, 1 Sam. xix. 24. Thus Peter was naked in the boat,
John xxi. 7, who therefore is said to have put on ἐπενδύτην,
1101 certainly his innermost garment or shirt, but, as its name
intimates, that which was put on above the other, to wit, his
robe, which, as we said, was made fast about them with the girdle3
whence it is also said, τὸν ἔπευὸὗτηυ διεζώσατο, ‘he girded his

upper coat.’ ''
