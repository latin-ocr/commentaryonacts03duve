And that same trunk‘s confused heft
They durst not to the funeral west,
But to the fowls untoueh’d it left,

And for a prey unto wild beasts,

If thereon they durst make their seasts.

The import of that word, πιμπρᾶσὲαι, could not be more accurately
set forth. Even from that place (besides the so clear description
of both the symptoms) you may see how emphatieally the ancient
Latin interpreter translates here, ‘should be turned into tumour3’ or,
to wit, that he is no more the same man, but altogether a tumour3 or,
to use the words of Lucan, ‘that his form and shape should be lost? ’³

Or suddenly fall down and die. That is, that he should suddenly
fall down dead. Avicenna saith that “ the greatest part of them
who die by the biting of a serpent, die the third day, and some-
times continue until the seventh.” AEtius saith that “for the most
part they die in seven hours' space.’' In Pliny, lib. xi. cap. 53:
“ The Scythians dip their arrows in vipers’ poison and human
blood;’' that irremediable wickedness bringeth instantly death at
the lightest touch. And in the Baeotics of Pausanius it is declared
by a certain Phoenician, “that a man, to escape the assault of a
viper that was pursuing him, quickly got upon a certain trec,
whither, when the viper came a little after, it discharged its poison
on the tree, and that thereupon the man died.’' So there is a sort
of serpents among the Arabians called giaria, which immediately
kills. VVhence Muhamed Addamirius, who is commonly called
Damir, in his Proverbs of the Viper, saith: “ God hath given him
over to the serpent giaria’' [which] is as much as to say, he hath
exposed him to an irremediable evil; because whosoever is bit by
this serpent dieth in the very moment. Indeed, the biting of
a viper is more pernicious, by reason of the nature of the place 01·
ailment, and if it bites fasting, or in the hottest weather, and when
it is provoked. For then its bile being stirred up, the poison is
much stronger. Resides, some bodies, and in one and the same
body, some parts less resist the poison. Seeing therefore there are
so many causes why vipers kill either quicker or slower by their
biting, the time of death cannot certainly be determined. But that
serpent that assailed Paul might be supposed to have most ready
poison, because it broke out of the midst of the fire more stirred up
and provoked.

After they lead looked α yreat while. As if he had said, But when
these barbarians had a considerable time expected that Paul’s
death would ensue upon the biting of the viper.
