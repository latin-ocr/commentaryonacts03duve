222 THE ACTS oF THE HoLY APOSTLES [CHAP. vm.

ling, brought into its place with great boldness, lest those that were
to be baptized in cold countries and seasonS, if they should be
plunged according unto Christ’s cmnmandment, might fall into
diseases, or be chilly with cold3 for the heating of the water might
be a sufficient remedy against this evil, or danger, as the above
quoted excellent divine, and reformer, John Bugenhagius in his
aforementioned German book, doth urge more at large. “An-
ciently, ζ when rhantism was not yet substituted for baptis1n,)'’ says
the English Chrysostom of this age, “Those who were baptized,
put off their garments‚ which signified the putting off of the body
of sin3 and were immersed, and buried in thewater, to represent
the death of sin3 and then did rise up again out of the water, to
signify their entrance upon a new life3 and to these customs the
apostle alludes, Rom. vi. &c.” Thus the very reverend John
Tillotson, D.D. dean of Canterbury, a man of great liberality
toward the poor (which I myself profess with a grateful mind, that
I have oftentimes had experience of it,) commended by all good
men for the excellency of his wit, the uprightness of his mind, the
purity of his manners and doctrine, in a grave and famous sermon
on 2 Tim. ii. 19. ‘⁶ Christians,'' says another doctor in divinity,
who excels in every sort of learning, and zeal of true piety, “being
plunged into the water in baptism, signifieth their undertaking,
and obliging themselves in a spiritual sense to die, and be buried
with J esus Christ (which death and buria] consists in an utter
renouncing and forsaking of all their sins‚) that so, answerably to
his resurrection, they may live a holy and godly lifef’ So that
reverend minister of the gospel, Edward Fowler, canon of
Gloucester, in his admirable book concerning the scope of the Chris-
tian religion, doth interpret the force of the words of the apostle,
Rom. vi. 4. Deservedly therefore that most learned Anonymus
protestant of France, who answereth to that tractate concerning
the communion under two kinds of my lord James Benigne
Bossuet, the famous bishop of Meaux, saith, pp. 24, 25, “It is
most certain that baptism hath not been administered hitherto,
otherwise than by sprinkling by the most part of protestants, but
truly this sprinkling is an abuse. This custom, which without an
accurate examination‚ they have retained from the Romish church,
in like manner as many other things, makes their baptism very
defective. It corrupteth its institution, and ancient use, and that
nearness of similitude, which is needful should be betwixt it and
