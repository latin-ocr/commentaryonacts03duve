speaking of the Jews, whom he foresaw would reject the Messiah
promised in the law and the prophets, with ungrateful minds and
stubborn obstinacy, he calls them the brethren of those Jews who
were to embrace him by faith, Isa. lxvi. 5. Hear, saith he, the
word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word, yom- brethren that
laeated yon, tlzat cast you out for my name's sake, said, &c. The

Donatists, the most malicious enemies of the church, brethren.

I. Paul, who now am brought before you as a criminal.

See below, ch. xxiv. 163 2 Cor. i. 123 2 Tim. i. 3. But how
Paul, now a convert to Christianity, could glory of his life while

he ought to do, to wit, that he should persecute the Christians,
who, he was persuaded, were apostates and revolters from the law
of Moses. Yet he was not innocent, because when 116 had sufficient
occasion of inforining his conscience better, he neglected to do it.
Wherefore he that will be free from sin must take no less care that
he instruct his conscience about the will of God, than that he do
