not only said in his book¹ of the original and continency of sacred
men, upon which account he was miserably abused by the Jesuit
Dionysius Petavius ; ‘³ but also the same Medina affirmed the same
openly in the Council of Trent, neither did he stick (though many
fretted at it) publicly to contend, that so far Jerome and Augustine
had an heretical opinion, the matter, to wit, not being altogether
clear. Which as it moved others not a little, “So,'' saith the
writer of the history of the Council of Trent, “this doctor, sticking
close to his own opinion, maintained it with his might.” Neither
is there aught that makes against it in Sforza Pallavieini’s his-
tory of the Council of Trent, against Paulus Venetus, published
at Rome, Anno 1657. Further, Petavius himself doth also
witness, that Medina was not 1116 only man among the papists
who was of this judgment, but that others also did ascribe the said
heresy to the forecited fathers. And Morton in the forementioned
place of his Apology³ does adduce some of them. Rivet also :4
“ Therefore, although according to the ternis of honour, which the
church now useth, as saith Augustine in his epistle to Jerome, the
episcopacy be greater than the presbytery, yet Richard of Armagh
said truly, There is no difference found in the evangelical or
apostolical scriptures betwixt bishops and simple priests, who are
called presbyters3 whence it follows that there is the same power
in both.” ‘⁶ Whether,'’ saith Cassander,⁵ “ 1116 episcopacy ought to
be put among the orders of the church, is not agreed upon betwixt
the theologues and the canonists3 but it is agreed upon among all,
that in the age of the apostles, there was no difference betwixt
bishops and presbyters 3 but that afterward, to evite schism a
bishop was set over presbyters.’' But as Musculus, in his
common places, saith excellently of the ministers of the word:⁶
“ WVhether this counsel whereby such bishops are more by
custom introduced, to use J erome's words, than by the truth of
the Lord's appointment, 10 116 greater than presbyters, be profitable
for the church of Christ or not, hath been better manifestes] in the
following ages, than when this custom was first introduced,’' &c.
See what follows there, and the history of episcopacy written in
English not long ag0, by that indefatigable preacher of God’s word,
the Rev. Richard Baxter, famous for knowledge and piety.⁷
