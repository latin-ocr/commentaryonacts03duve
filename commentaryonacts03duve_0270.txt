G1·ee])itzytllz'7zq.c. A creeping creature, or reptile is called Ὦὶῖρᾟ,
“ from treading the ground,” and 33³3), from plenty, and ἒζτῑ from
the slowness of its motion. The noun reptile& Gen. ix. 3, and in
other places is often taken for anything that treads. Sometimes
it is opposed to four--footed beasts and birds, and so it includes
fishes, as here, and Lev. xi. 463 Rom. i. 23. For a water-animal
111 the Hebrew phrase is called 07722: niun] Πζτζτ, “a creature creeping
in the waters.” For although Πηίᾩ, “ to swim,'’ is proper to water-
creatures, whence they are called νηκτὰ, “ swimmers,” Wisd. xix-
18, yet the scripture says they creep in the waters, hut never
says they swim.⁷’ “Everything that swims,'' saith Α111111050,1
“has the figure, or nature, of a creeping thing. For although,
when they have plunged themselves into the bottom, they seem to
cleave the water, yet when they swim on the top, their whole
body creeps, and is drawn over the uppermost parts of the water.
Also amphibious ereatures, which have feet and the use of going,
yet when they are 011 the top of the waters, they do not walk, but
swim 3 neither use they the sole of the foot for treading, but as an
oar for creeping. Lastly, in scripture every creature is said to
be a reptile, which is neither a four-footed creature, somewhat
big, nor a bird, nor a fish. So Moses places amongst reptiles the
small four-footed creatures, as inice and moles, Lev. xi. 29, or all
that are without blood, or creep upon their bellies, as worms,
whether they fly, as, besides some locusts, fiies, butterflies, &e.‚
whether four-footed as locusts, or have many feet, as the worm
