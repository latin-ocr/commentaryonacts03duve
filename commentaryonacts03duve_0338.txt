Purifyz'ny their hearts by saith. That is, when he had oleansed
the minds of these unoircumcised Gentiles from the sins wherewith
they were defiled, by a lively saith on Christ3 with which who-
soever is endued, presently resolves to renounce all impiety and
worldly desires, and to live soberly, justly, and godly in this world.

10. Now therefore why tempt ye God? That is, why do you
grievously offend God‘? “He that offends God,” saith Grotius,
“tempts his patience, and he offends him who opposes his will,
sufficiently revealed.''

To put, &c. As going about to impose the yoke of all the
ceremonies of the law on the necks of all such Gentiles as have
believed on Christ, which the Israelites themselves were never
able to bear, but with the greatest molestation.

The yoke. To wit, of bondage, as Paul calls the legal rites,
Gal. v. 1, because they consisted in things indifferent, which of
themselves were neither good nor requisite‚ but depended only on
the pleasure of the law-giver, so that they seemed suited rather to

vi. 60.

11. But by tlte qrace of our Lord Jesus, &c. Even we ourselves
who are Jews originally, having embraced the faith of Christ, are
most certainly persuaded, that not by circumcision or other rites
of the Mosaical law, but by the gracious reconciliation of us to
G0d‚ we shall obtain eternal salvation purchased by the sacrifice of
the death of Christ. The same Paul teaches, Gal. ii. 15, 16.

Even as they. To wit, the disciples lately converted to Christ
out of the Gentiles, of whom was treated before, v. 7-10, do
believe that they by the same free gracious benefit exhibited to
