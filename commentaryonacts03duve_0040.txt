20 THE ACTS OF THE IIOLY APOSTLES [CHAP. 1.

not of the Grecian, but the H cbrew furlongs, of which seven and a
half make a mile, or sabbath-day's journey. See Baal Aruch upon
the word ow, rus. See the Jewish Map set forth at Amsterdam3
where seven furlongs and a half make a Hebrew short mile3 and

four short miles a long one called Parsa.

Jerusalem.

They went into an upper room. The Greek has it, “into the
upper part of the house.” But whose house this was is a thing
very much controverted among the learned. NicephoruS, out of
one Euodius,¹ affirms it to have been the house of St. John the
Evangelist, the son of Zebecleus. Baronius and Bede assert it to
have been the house of that Mary who was the mother of John,
surnamed Mark, of whom Luke makes mention in some chapters
lower. Theophylaot2 believes it to have been the house of Simon
the leper. Others will have it to have been the house of
Nicodemus, or J oseph of Arimathea. For my part I am apt to
believe, that this house was the temple of Jerusalem itself,
according to the testimony of Luke himself in his gospel: And
they returned to Jerusalem with yreat joy; and were continually in
tlte temple, praisz'ny and blessz'ny God, ch. xxiv. 52, 53. Observe‚ that
it is there said, “ they were there continually,’' which is here said,
they were “remaining together,’' which being the same in signi-
fication, you shall never reconcile the two places if they remained
in any other place than the temple. ‘⁶ Neither is this opinion
obstructed,” saith the famous Lewis de Dieu, “ by this, that they
are said to have ascended into an upper room, or according to the
Syrian interpreter, into a dining room, for that the temple had
several upper rooms built round about the outside of it is apparent
from the lst of Chron. xxviii. ll, and 2 Chron. iii. 9. As also
chambers and apartments, such as was the chamber of Gemariah,
where Baruclz read the book qf' Jeremialz in the house (gf the Lord,
Jer. xxxvi. 10. “ And Bai-uch read in the book the words of
Jeremiah in the house of the Lord, in the house of Gemariah‚''
according to the Septuagint3 where we are also to observe that
the temple is not only called a house, but also that the chamber is
also translated a house, both there and ver. 12, 20, 21, as like-
wise ch. xxxv. 4, just as the upper chamber where the apostles
were, Acts i. 13, is called a house, Acts ii. 2 3 for those chambers
