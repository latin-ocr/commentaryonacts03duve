rme. xxxix] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 537

37. We were in all two hundred seventy-se'a: sauls. That is, pers011S,
as above, ch. ii. 41 3 and ver. 10, 22, of this chapter.

38. And when they had eaten enouqlz. That is, as Virgil
expresses it, AEn. i. ver. 220 :—

When hunger was allay'd and boards remov'd.

They lz'ylztened tlze ship. That is, they cast out the ship's lading,
that the ship sailing more light, they might get the nearer to land,
and so easilier escape to shore.

Castz‘ny out tlze wlzeat into the sea. It appears that this Alexandrian
ship carried eorn or wheat from Egypt into Italy, and that she was
laden with that merehandize. But this method is used in lightening
a ship, which also we have in this history. First, the more weighty
fardels and ponderous goods are cast out, as above, ver. 183 then
the furniture, or materials of the ship, as above, ver. 193 and finally,
the food, as in this 38th verse.

39. And wlzen z't was day. And the sun-beams had expelled the
darkness.

They did not know the land. That is, the mai-iners knew not
what elimate they were in, or how that land was called, to which
they suspected that they were come near, above, ver. 27, but now
they saw that they were upon it.

Bac they discovered a certain creele wz'tlz α shore. That is, but they
perceived a certain part of the sea that was not beset with steep
rocks, but intercepted by shores not far distant one from another.
‘⁶ Κόλπος in the Greek,” saith Grotius, “in Latin sinus, ‘ a bay or
creek,' sometimes is spoken of the sea, sometimes of the land, as
here3 for it is distinguished from the shore. But these are some
bays of the sea which have no shore, but are encompassed with
steep rocks.”

Into which. Seeing the Greek word αἰγιαλὸς, which signifies
the shore or border of the sea, is of the masculine gender, the
relative pronoun may as well here be referred to sinus, “ oreek,” as
to littus, “shore” The seamen indeed were desirous to get the
ship to the shore, as is deelared in the next verse, but possibly they
first desired to get to that creek of the sea that was encompassed
with shores.

They tltozcgjlzt. Greek, ἐβουλεύσαντο, “ They were minded.”
That is, they unanimously determined.

To tlzrust in the ship. That is, that they might get free of the
tossings of the sea into a safe place.
