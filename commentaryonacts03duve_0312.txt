21. And afterward, &c. As much as to say, But afterward, to
wit, when Samuel had governed the eommonwealth one and twenty
years, they, after the example of other nations, asked a king, 1 Sam.
viii. 5, 193 and at the importunate desire of the people, God gave
them a king in his anger, Hos. xiii. 10, 11, 811111 1110 5011 of
Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, but not of the tribe of Judah,
for whom the seeptre seems to have been appointed of old, Gen.

By tlte space offortgs years. Seeing that Islibosheth, when he
suooeeded his father Saul in the kingdom, was forty years of age,
2 Sam. ii. 10, we understand that Ishbosheth was born at the same
time as Saul was first privately anointed, then publiely deelared king
before the people at Mizpeh, 1 Sam. x. 1, 24, 25. “Nor was it

feast of Pentecost, and at the beginning of the third mouth, one

away, was restored at the same time of the harvest, 1 Sam. xi. 13.
whereby we may gather, that as there were twenty years betwixt
the bringing again of the ark and the subduing the Philistines,
from 1 811111. vii. 2, 13; 50 11150 that there passed a year betwixt the
freeing of the Israelites' land from the Philistines, and Saul’s being
‹leolared king, is gathered from these words, 1 Sam. xiii. 1, Saul
reissned one year, and when lle lead rezyned two years over Israel.
WVhereof a better sense cannot be given than thau—that one year
was passed since the subduing of the Philistines by Samuel, when
Saul began to reign, and that he reigned two years after, free
