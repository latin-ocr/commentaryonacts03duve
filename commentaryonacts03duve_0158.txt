App-eamd anto our father Abraham. Stephen might use this
expression, not only as a Christian, but also as a J ew, or a prose-
lyte of the Jewish religion. “The God of the Jews, who calls
himself the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and of Jacob, is
also the God of the proselytes ς for the proselytes worshipped one
and the same God, and bound themselves to observe the same law
with that which he gave to the Jews. If they could call the God
of the Jews their God, as well as the «Jews, who can deny that
they could eall Abraham their father? But seeing Abraham, by
the promise made by God to him, was called 1116 father of nations;

to be extended so far3 nor had Abraham then come from the east,
but rather from the north. N either can a demonstrative argument
be drawn from the similitude of names (such as is that of the
Persian castle in Marcellinus, whither hc reporteth that Cassianus
and Mauritius came), as Bcchart himself elsewhere observes. Isaac
Vossius, a very learned man, will have Ur to be the same with
Chebar or Chebar, at the confluence of the Chabor and Euphrates3

ful for those 11161 were journeying to Canaan to go up into Charran,
nor was that a city of Chaldaea. Therefore it is uncertain whether
it be Ura, mentioned by Pliny,3 in the turning of Euphrates to-
