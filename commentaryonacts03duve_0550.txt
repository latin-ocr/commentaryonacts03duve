Africa of unequal bigness, but of the same nature, of which those
that are next the land are very deep, but the rest, as it chanceth,
at one time are deep, at another shallow. For when the sea begins
to swell and rage with the winds, the waves draw slime, sand, and
great stones together in heaps3 and so the figure of these places is
changed together with the winds.'’ They are called sirts, from

lively description of a dreadful tempest, Psal. evii. 25, 26, which
Virgil imitating, hath elegantly expressed in these words, AEn. iii.
ver. 564 :—

At heaven we tilt, then suddenly we fell,
Wat’ry foundations sinking low as hell.

The nexi clay they Zigyhtenesl the shz'p. That is, the mai-iners cast
