become our King, to whom we must 1111 join ourselves if we hope
for safety. In whom we see a figure of that glorious King, who
shall hereafter be in like manner refused, Luke‘xix. 14, xx. 17,
and then be by God exalted to be Lord of all the world, and the
vfoundation of all men’s happiness.'’ See our literal explication,

M. . xxi. 42.
ign. Neitlaer is there. As if he had said, In this Christ alone, God

hath put the salvation of all men, even their eternal salvation,
‘⁶ which is not to be attained but by the mediator of God and men,
the man J esus Christ,'' as saith Leo the Great„

For there is no other name. That is, any other person. So
ch. i. 15. N ame 15 taken for person. And 11616 there seems to be

dangers and vows they are wont to be invoked, and their names to
be expressed from whom we expect assistance and safety.

Under heaven. That is, in any place whatever. A synecdoche

seek our salvation, or through whom we must of necessity obtain
our salvation, if we intend to be saved.

with understanding.

And idiots. That is, plebeians, men of mean and inconsiderable
fortunes, as l Sam. xviii. 23: A poor man and lzssqlztly esteemed,
or “contemned and abject,'’ is rendered by the Chaldee para-
phrast, “a poor man and an idiot.’' And ch. xxiv. 14, where
David in contempt calls himself α dead (1⁷09 and α flea, the
Chaldee paraphrast renders it ‘⁶ weak, and idiot.”
