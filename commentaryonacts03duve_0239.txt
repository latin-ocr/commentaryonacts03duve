burg, “that this sprinkling was an abuse which they ought to
remove.'' Thus plunging was restored at Hamburg.

Common fonts, big and large enough, were in ancient times
fitted and acconunodated to dipping, in the which fonts, by
conduits, or certain inferior passages, the water overflowing upon
the baptizcd, did run away, as is manifest even by this memorable
history of Socrates, which we do here bring in.¹ A certain
deceiver, a J ew by nation, counterfeiting himself to be a Christian,
was ostentimes baptized, and by this sort of cheat had scraped
together much money. When he had deceived many Christian
sects by this craft, for he had been baptized both by the Arians
and Macedonians, having none more whom he could deceive, at
length he came to Paul bishop of the Novatians, and affirming
that he had an earnest desire to be baptized, he prayed the bishop
that he would be pleased to baptize him himself. He indeed
praised the Jew’s will and desire, but did deny that he could give
him baptism, before he had been instructed in the principles of
faith, and besides all this, had fasted many days. But the J ew,
who contrary to his wish or expectation was compelled to fast, did
so much the more urge that he might be baptized. The bishop
therefore not willing to offend him with a longer delay, when he
pressed, and urged him to it, prepares the things that are necessary
to baptism. And when he had brought a white gai-ment to the
J ew, and commanded the belly of the font to be filled with water,
he brought the Jew thither, as if he were going to baptize him.
But a certain secret virtue and power of God made the water
suddenly to vanish. But when the bishop, and those who were
present, suspecting nothing of what then was done, they did think
that the water ran out by some secret passage underneath, where
it was wont to be let out, they fill the belly of it again, after they
had carefully stopped all the passages. And when the J ew was
brought again to the font, the water did again altogether vanish.
Then Paul said, Either, O Man, thou deceivest, or hast unknowingly
received the sacrament of baptism before. When therefore a great
many men fiocked together to see this miracle, one that knew the
J ew, found him to be the self-same man that was baptized before
by bishop Atticus.’' Hereto belongs also what the Magdeburg
Centuriators do relate of Rathold.2 ‘⁶ In the- year of the Lord, say
they, 718, Rathold, general of the Frisians, was brought unto this
