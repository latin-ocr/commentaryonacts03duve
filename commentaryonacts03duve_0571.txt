leaving ye shall return to Christ, as Dice did of old after the
slaughter of the ploughing OX. Nor is it to be wondered that the
fame of the Greek goddess should come to the inhabitants of Malta,
the most of whom were Phoenicians3 forasmuch as before the
Romans' invasion of Malta, the government of the island did
change by courses, so among the Greeks and Phoenicians, that some-
times the one, sometimes the other commanded in chief, as we have
made appear elsewhere by the testimony of competent witnesses.
The worship therefore of this goddess being borrowed from the
Greeks, they attribute to her that Paul being delivered from the
peril he was in upon the sea, fell into another danger no less than
the former. Their opinion is so far allowable, as they hold it
impossible for transgressors to go unpunished. Plato spoke a
great truth in his fifth book of Laws, where he says that all in-
justice is attended with punishment. And Horace, in the second
song of his third book :—

The wicked man that walks with braz'n face,
Is seldom left by vengeance's halting pace.

Further, that vipers are used by God for the punishment of
the wicked is recorded, Eccles. xxxix, 35, 383 the teeth of wild
beasts, and scorpions, with vipers, and the sword that despatcheth
the wicked. The Egyptians were fully of the same mind with
reference to the asp, named ThermuthiS, AElian, lib. x. cap. 31.
They say of her, that she does no hurt to the good, whilst she
kills the wicked. ‘Which if it be so,’ says AElian, ‘the justice of
the universe has highly honoured this asp.’ That is, the goddess
Dice, that punishes a great many by this instrument. Therefore
there was something in the barbarians’ judgment of Paul not
altogether to be despised. But yet it is manifest that they judged
amiss in many respects. As, first, in that they do not attribute the
punishment of the wicked to the true God, but to an idol the work
of men's hands, which by some is named Dice, by others Themis,
by other some Astrea, or Erigone, as also Nemesis, or Adrastia.
Secondly, because by this course they hold that the wicked are
always punished in this life, whilst they are very often reserved
for the future, where God makes up the slowness of his judgments
by their weight. Thirdly‚ because they think none falls into any
heavy calamity, but he is proportionably guilty, not knowing or
considering that affliction is the lot of the best, as we find in the
instances of J ob, and him that was born blind, though neither he
