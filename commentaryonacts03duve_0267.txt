will instruct thee in the knowledge of Christ (which is the only
way to salvation), that thou, and thy whole house, may be saved.
God uses no other way, but the instrument of preaching, to instil
into men the knowledge of the gospel. “This is God's ordinary
way which he hath established, and we may not expect another,’'
most truly saith (and proves it, from Rom. x. 14) my dearest
wife’s uncle, the Rev. Samuel Gardner, Doctor of Divinity, one of
his majesty's chaplains in ordinary, in his grave and learned sermon
on the dignity and duty of the ministers of the gospel, printed in
1672.

7. Α soldier, feariny God. All the domestics of Cornelius feared
the Lord, as is said before, ver. 2, but all the soldiers which were
under his command, were not godly and religious. We have a like
παραλληλισμὸς of soldiers and domestics, Matt. viii. 9.

Of them that waz'ted οη lzz'm. That is, they waited before the
doors to receive his commands. Ovid, speaking of a lover and a
soldier, saith,

‘⁶ This tends his mistress's, but that his captain’s, (loors.”

· 8. lVlzen lze had (Zeclared all these thiu-qs to them. Cornelius
explained all things to his soldiers and servants, the inore to
encourage them to perform a command, which they saw was more
God’s than man's. “He doubted not,'⁷ saith Calvin, “to trust
those with this great secret, whom he had before trained honestly
up.'’

9. Peter went up to tlte house-top. Greek, “to the roof ot* the
l1onse.’' The Jews built the roofs of their houses flat, not spire-
wisc. Jerome, in his epistle to Sunia and Fretela, says, “that
in the eastern provinces, that is called δῶμα, which the Latins call
tectum. For, in Palestine and Egypt, or in those places where the
holy bible was writ or interpreted, their houses are not ridged but
flat roofed, which at Rome they call leads or balconies, that is, flat
roofs supported by beams placed across?⁹ The Vulgate translation
uses this word for a house, Prov. xxi. 93 xxv. 24. Anselni, on
Matthew, fol. 45: “In Palestine they used to make their roofs
flat, not coped. Even so the temple of Solonion was made flat
above, and in the circuit of the gallery there were grates, lest any
one should unawares fall down: and the doctors had there their
scats, that they might from thence speak to the people.⁷’
