iv HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION.

gress in the science of mental philosophy. In regard to religion this is of
the utmost moment, and must necessarily regulate our contempt or admi-
ration. The researches of a mind really engaged in the pursuit 01 truth
are worthy 01 the greatest attention; its struggles claim our sympathy; its
progress on this great voyage of discovery, as we may say, may assist our
own inquiries, or strengthen our own saith.

Few persons, we believe, hold important truth firmly who have not ex-
perienced some, it may be very considerable, alterations of opinion. Light
has broken in gradually upon them, errors have been for a time tenaciously
held; but the day of their knowledge has often been the brighter for the
mists of the early morning. All minds indeed are not thus, or similarly
constituted ; but we must make allowances for those that are, and gain this
general instruction from their history, to look well and often to the founda-
tions, that we may secure the stability of our saith.

These remarks have been elicited by a view 01 the peculiar career 01 the
author of the following Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles. But of
this we know little more than the general outline. Memoranda, letters,
and documents of a similar kind which would have interested us, do not
appear to have survived the wreck of time. While these might be very
well dispensed with in ordinary cases, their almost entire absence is to be
greatly regretted in the present instance, as the mind 01 Du Veil passed
through many and remarkable changes. These he had the nobleness to avow
as they occurred, though the particular processes of thought are not re-
corded; sufficient evidence however being afforded that they were not the
result of a spirit of vacillation, or of imbecility of judgment, but rather of
patient inquiry, deliberate reflection, and profound conscientiousness.

With what scanty materials of his life we are furnished we shall now
proceed to supply our readers; and as they chiefly relate to vicissitudes of
opinion, they will the better prepare us for duly appreciating the present,
which is among the last of his critical compositions.

Carolus Maria de Veil, or as it is frequently written Duveil‚ was born of
J ewish parents, and was educated accordingly. His writings furnish ample
evidence of his intimate acquaintance with the rites and ceremonies of that
people. Endowed with a strong and inquiring mind, however, the result
of a careful investigation 01 the prophetica] parts of the Old Testament was,
an irresistible conviction that Jesus Christ was the true Messialn a dis-
covery which induced him without hesitation to embrace Christianity. His
father violently resented this departure from his educational saith. and even
attempted to kill him with a sword 3 from which danger he was only rescued
