14. And when Ize met with. us at Assos. To wit, Paul.

We took him in. Into the ship.

And came to [Mitylene. The chief city of the island Lesbos,
which Vitruvius saith,1 was magnificently and stately built, but
not wisely situated: in which, when the south wind blows, men
are sick: when the north-west, they cough3 when the north, they
are restored to health. This city was famous for Pittacus, one of
the seven famous wise men of Greece3 Alcaeus, a noble lyric poet3
the famous poetess Sapphus, and that excellent rhetorician
Diophanes, who was master to Gracchus, and to that Theophanes
who wrote the exploits of Pompey the Great, and was very familiar
with him, and received of him the freedom of the city in an
assembly of soldiers, as Cicero saith in his oration for Archias, a
poet of Antioch.

15. Over ayainst Chios. Which is an island in the AEgean Sea,
about nine hundred furlongs in compass, bordering upon Ionia,
between the islands Samos and Lesbos. This island was famous
for wine, figs, and marble. Its wine was the best of all the Greek
wines, as Strabo‘2 and Horace³ do witness, The Chian fig is cornw
mended by Martial,4 who for its excellency calls it Chia. Pliny 5
commends the Chian marble: also the Chian earth is by him said
to have the same effect in medicine, as the Samian earth. It had
famous men, Ion, Orchomenis’s son, a tragic and lyric poet, and a
philosopherg TheopOmPUS, the son of Damasistratus, both an orator
and an historiam Theocritus, of the same age as Theopompus, and
emulating him in governing the commonwealth. The Chians also
challenged Homer as theirs, by an argument from the family of the
Homer-ides, famous among the Chians, who boasted they were of
Homer’s lineage3 and also Prodicus the philosopher, who said that
such things as were profitable for man's life have been esteemed to
bc among the number of the gods, of which Strabo in the forecitcd
book and Cicero,6 are evident witnesses.

We came to Samos. That is, we arrived at the famous Samos
over against the island Caria. ‘⁶ Samos‚'’ saith Thomas de Pinedo,
‘⁶ Same, and Samothrace, or Samothracia, were different islands,
although of old Samothracia was also called Samos3 for Samo-
thracia was in the AEgean Sea, Same in the Ionian, near Zacyn-
thus3 but Samos, of which we now speak, lies in the Icarian Sea.
And as Lemnus worshipped Vulcan, Delus Apollo, so Samos
