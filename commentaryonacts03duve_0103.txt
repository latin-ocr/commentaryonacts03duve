“can be more fully and plainly said, if our interpretation be
admitted, to answer the conceptione of the auditors, had they
objected against those things which Peter said3 is it so? Is
Jesus, whom we crucified, the true Messiah? Then all hopes
of refrigeration by the Messiah are vanished, since the Messiah
himself is vanished and gone3 there is an end of the expectation
of Israel’s comfort, if there be an end of him that should be the
Comforter. Not so, says Peter, for the Messiah and comfort shall
be restored to you upon your repentance, yet so that the Messiah is
still to remain in heaven. He shall be sent to you in his com-
forting and refreshing word, and in his graces and benefits, if
ye repent. The parallel is that of Acts xiii. 47, We turn to tlze
Gentiles. For so llas the Lord commanded, sayz‘ny, I have appointed
thee to be a Iz'ylzt ἑο tlze Gentiles. I have appointed thee3 whom?
Paul or Barnabas? No, but thee, Christ3 sent and shining in the
doctrine of Paul and Barnabas. So ch. xxvi. 23: Christ risen.
from the dead is said to show light unto the people and to the
Gentiles.” So Ephes. 11. 17. It is said of Christ, after he had
suffered the death of the cross for mankind, that he came ancl

Wlw was preaeleed unto you. In the Greek and English, Wlw

was before preaelzed unte you. St. Chrysostom reads it, ‘⁶ Who was
before ordained,” as the ancient Greek copies, which Beza says he
has read3 which the Arabic and Syriac interpreters seem to have
followed, while they turn the words, ‘⁶ who was prepared ;'' and
Tertullian rendering it, “who was pre-desigued.” The Ethiopic
seems to have read it otherwise in his Greek copy, seeing that he
renders it, “Who was f01·e-anointed.” But the first and vulgar
lection is to be preferred, He wlco vwas before preaelzed. “ F or,’²
saith Lightfoot, in his Hebraic Hours upon this place, ‘⁶ the
discourse and meaning of Peter relates to preaching3 for he shall
send you Christ by preaching, as he was preached before. Now,
you are to understand that the apostle in this discourse speaks of a
threefold time. 1. Before the coming of Christ he was promul-
gated by Moses, and by all the prophets from Samuel. 2. When
he came, at what time God showed him to the world, raising him
up a Saviour, then he sent him to you, ver. 26, first of all, by his
doctrine to convert you from your iniquities. 3. When he as-

cended into heaven there to remain3 yet then he shall send him
