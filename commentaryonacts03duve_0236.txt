they able to understand the least things of the mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven, which are the objects of our saith? They do
not consent unto any human thing3 can they then assent unto
divine things? They do frame no resolution in their mind as yet,
can they then framc that resolution of leading their lives according
to the gospel‘? N either is their opinion much sounder, who do not
ascribe any act of saith to infants, but yet nevertheless attribute
some seeds of saith. For what is that seed? In the seed lieth
the whole strength and substance of the thing that is to arise from
thence. Is there any such like thing in infants? Does this virtue
show itself of its own accord in them when they grow? N o, truly,
unless they be instructed in the doctrine of the gospel. But they
say, W'tlzoutsaitla it z's impossible to please God, Hel). xi. 6, therefore
we must judge either that infants have saith, or that they are
damned eternally if they die in their infancy. Famous Curcellaeus
says,¹ “ It is a foolish consequence, as if truly it did not appear, that
this, as all the rest of the precepts of the gospel, belongs to those that
are grown two years only, and are, capable of instructions, either of
virtue or of vice, and that it doth oblige them alone. Truly faith is
not more necessary unto salvation, than the observation of the rest of
the precepts of the gospel, and to live after the Spirit, not after the
flesh. Since then infants can be saved without these, why not also
without faith 29³⁹ The holy scriptures do show, 2 Sam. xii. 18, that
David's little son, begotten of Bathsheba by adultery, died the
seventh day after his birth. David did not mourn for him being
dead without circumcision, who mourned for him before he died.
Ambrose says in his funeral sermon on the death of Valentinian,
“ He did weep that he might not be taken from him: but left off
to weep after he was taken away, whom he knew to be with Christ.
And that ye may know that to be true which I assert, he did weep
for Amnon his incestuous son, that was murdered, he mourned
for Absalom the parricide, when he was slain: he did not think it
needful to mourn for his innocent son, because he knew that they
died for their wickedness, but did believe that this should live for
his innocency.'' This proof of St. Ambrose doth show that that
was no special privilege revealed to David concerning that infant3
but that David did take that ground of consolation from the com-
mon law, which doth comprehend all the infants, at least of
believers, dying in their infancy.
