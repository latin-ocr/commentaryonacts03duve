baptism, that it may show a sure and plain sign of it.'' The

‘⁶ The other thing,” saith he, “which belongs to baptism, is the
sign or the sacrament, which is the dipping itself into the water,
from whence also it hath its name3 for, to baptize, in Greek, is to
dip, and baptism is dipping. For it has been said, that signs are
appointed according to the divine promises, which resembled that
thing which the words do signify, or as the later writers say, ⁶ the
sacrament effectually signifietl1.'” And a little afterwards: “ That
the minister dippeth a child into the water, signifieth death.
That he again bringeth him out of it signifieth life. So Paul
expounds, Rom. vi.'’ And a few words afterwards: ‘⁶ That there-

In a general assembly, therefore, of all the ministers of the word
that was convened, he did ask of a certain minister, ,John F ritz
by name, who was sometimes minister of Lubeck, how the sacra-
ment of baptism was administered at Lubeck? who for his piety
and candour did answer gravely, that the infants were baptized
naked at Lubcck after the same fashion altogether as in Ger-
many. But from whence and how that peculial· manner of bap-
tizing hath crept into Hamburg, he was ignorant„ At length
they did agree· among themselves that the judgment of Luther,
and of the divines of WVittenburg, should be demanded about this
point: which thing being done, Luther (lid write back to Ham-
