plainly demonstrate, as they allege, that it was the proper name of
some noble personage. The author of the books of Recognitions,

1111101· 1110 name of Clement,¹ the first of that name, bishop of
Rome, says that this Theophilus was one of the 111-1110111111 111011 of
Antiochia, who being converted by Peter to the saith of Christ
set apart his houses for the public and solemn meetings of the
0h11reh.‘2 Τ1100111151111013 011115 11115 Theophilus, a consular person, and
perhaps 11 11111100. A certain author cited by Abnlensis, conjectures
this Theophilus, prinee of Antiochia, to have been, after the depar-
ture of Peter, bishop of that eity3 and that upon his persuasion
and encouragement‚ both 1110 Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles
were written by St. Luke. Grotius believes him to have been the
chief magistrate of some city in Achaia, and baptized by Luke.
But though the additional most excellent, which by several writers
is frequently given to persons in high authority, as for example by
Paul, Acts xxiii. 263 xxvi. 25, 10 both the procurators or vice-
governors of Judaea, Felix and Festus, and by Josephus4 10
Epaphroditus, to whom he dedicates the History of his Life, and
by J nstin Martyr 10 Diognetus, to whom he writes a Compendium
of the Christian Religion: yet it does not seem to be a note of
dignity in Theophilus, in regard it does not appear likely that St.
Luke would have omitted to have given the same addition to
Theophilus when he recommends to him his Acts of the Apostles,
had it been a 11110 of dignity. Therefore Origen,5 81. Ambrose,6
and Ε1111111111111157 believe it more probablc that Theophilus was an
appellative made use of by St. Luke, 115 belonging to all that pro-
fessed the Christian religion out of a sineere love of God. ‘·' Nor
ought it,’' saith Camero,8 ‘⁶ to be thought a thing out of practice,
seeing that Athanasius uses the same sort of compellation. For in
his book of the Incarnation, he gives the titles of happy, and friend
of Christ, and sometimes both together, without distinction, to every
pious and true Christian.'’

Which Jesus beyan to do and teaclz. That 15, which make to the
whole of our salvation froin the beginning of the works and doc-
trine of Christ. Learnedly the Greek scholiast observes, that
Luke wrote of all things from the beginning 1111 J esus was trans-
lated into heaven, of which 81. Chrysostom takes notice also,
