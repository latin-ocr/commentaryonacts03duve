Sataros, as Pliny relates 3² afterwards by Ptolomaeus Philadelphus,

saith Strabo.C From this city Apollo had the epithet of Pataraean3
for that in the winter half year he gave responses here, as he did
at Delos in the summer, according to Servius-‘⁵ His temple made
Patara a city of great note, being of equal esteem with that at
