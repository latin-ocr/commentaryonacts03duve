affirms,¹ “None, except grown to man or woman's estate, were
wont to be baptized.” The famous Bishop of MeauX, J. B. Bossuet,
in his French treatise of the Holy Supper under both kinds, p.
127: “As touching infants, the pretended reformed (so the papists
in France do call the protest-ants who follow Calvin’s opinions) say
that their baptism is grounded on the authority of the scripture3
but they bring us no place out of it, expressly affirming it, and
what consequences they draw out of the same, they are very far
fetched, not to say very doubtful, and too deceitful.’' One nameless
person, a very learned man, answering to the treatise of this learned
bishop, saith, p. 92: “As for the custom of ,baptizing infants, I
confess we nowhere read anything expressly and particularly writ-
ten in the gospel, from whence the necessity of paedobaptism can
be shown: and that those places of the gospel, by which it uses to
be proved, at the most do prove that that custom of baptizing of
infants is lawful and permitted, or rather not impermitted or un-
lawful. If all the anabaptists rested in that opinion, neither
condemned that custom of wickedness and sacrilege, reason would
be on their side, neither would they say anything which should
not be founded on the common principles of all protestants. The
primitive churches did not baptize infants3 the learned Grotius
hath made plain and proved that, in his notes on the gospel. That
doth most plainly appear by the very rite of baptizing used in the
Roman church. For baptism is to be asked before the person to
be baptized enter into the church, which the surety does in the
infant’s name, a clear and distinct confession of faith is required,
which the same surety rehearseth in the infant's name3 a renounc-
ing of the world, its pomps, the flesh and the devil, is to be
promised, which the surety, or as they call it, the godfather
promiseth for the infant3 is not this a clear argument, that of old,
the persons who were to be baptized, asked for themselves baptism
in their own name, of their own choice, and profess their saith,
and were wont to renounce their former life, to consecrate the
remainder of their life in this present morta] flesh to Jesus
Christ ?’' Curcellaeus says, in his dissertation of original sin, num.
56, “that the custom of baptizing infants, was brought in without
the commandment of Christ, and did not begin before the third
age after Christ was born; in the two former ages no sign of it
