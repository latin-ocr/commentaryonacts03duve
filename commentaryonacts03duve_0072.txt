life affords me tranquillity and security of mind. Saith Kimchi,
in Ps. xvi. 9, “While I live my flesh shall remain in safety‚
because he shall deliver me from all harni.” But in a mysterious
sense, he believes it to be as if he had said, ‘⁶ After death my flesh
shall lie in the grave secure from worms, because they shall have
no power over it.’'

27. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell. The sense in refer·-
ence to David is, 1 Sam. xxii. 1, thou wilt not suffer me to be
slain by Saul3 but in relation to the Messiah‚ of whom David's
concerns were typeS, thou wilt not leave me long in the state of
the dead, or, which is the same thing, thou wilt not suffer my soul,
laid down for my sheep, to be a long time shut up within the
receptaole of souls separated from the body, into which I descended
to satisfy the law of death, as Ireneus speaks.¹ Worthily, there-
·fore, Grotius:2 “True it is,’' saith 116, “that hell is a place sub-
tracted from our sight, and when it is understood in reference to
the body it signifies the grave, where the body lies without a soul,
but in reference to the soul it denotes that region or state wherein
the soul remains without the body. Therefore as Dives was in
11611, 60 was also Lazarus, the regions only being distinguished.
For both Paradise and Gehenna, or, as the Greeks called those
places, Tartarus and Elysium, were in hell. And that this was
the opinion of the Greeks, is most certain, whom Virgil follows in
the sixth of his AEneids. Nor let any one question the JeWS, for
whom I bring Josephus to vouch, who says that the prophet
Samuel was raised by the witch out of hell. The same author,
speaking of the Sadducees, ‘ They take away‚' saith 116, ‘ all pun-
ishments and rewards out of hell? Again, where he sets down
the opinion of the Pharisees, he appoints the seat both of punish-
ment and reward in hell, under ground, because the infernal
regions by the Greeks are called subterranean, either because
hell was thought to be under ground, or rather because it is no
more in sight than the most hidden recesses which the earth
eonceals. Josephus,³ reciting the opinions of the Essenes, places
the souls of the godly beyond the ocean, to which in another place,
according to the judgment of the same persons, he allots the most
holy region of heaven. But indeed those phrases of speech, under
the carth, in the air, beyond the ocean, and what we find in
TertuUian, beyond the fiery zone, signify no more than that which
