lib. v. cap. 243 Strabo, Geogr. lib. xvi. andothers, reekoned a part
of Arabia. But now Charran, the place of N ahor's abode, called
by Josephus Χαρὰν, also Charrhai by Stephen, Ptolemy, and Sozo-
men ; Χαῤῥὰυ in the Acts3 by J erome Aran, as also Carrae, if it
be the same city with that of the Roman writers of the Crassian
overthrow, Charan by the Gcog. of N ubia, called also Nahor,
from N ahor who built and inhabited it, Gen. xxiv. 10, is situate
in that part of Mesopotamia, which the river Chabora watereth,
between Euphrates and Ascorus3 for by holy writ wc may learn
that Charran lay in the way that leadeth from Chaldca into
Canaan, Gen. xi. 31. So that it is altogether more southerly,
towards Arabia the Desert, and Syria Palmyrena, or Aram Tsaba.
For the way from Ur of the Chaldees to Palestine is from the
east to the west, except where to avoid the unpassable places of
Arabia travellers turn toward the north, through that part of
Mesopotamia that is more southerly, which is to the northward
of Chaldaea. Again, the country of Chat-ran was said to be east-
erly in respect of Palestine, Gen. xxix. 1. Hence it is certainly
in the southerly part of Mesopotamia, which borders with that part
of Arabia where the inhabitants dwell in tenta according to the
style of the scripture and the insight of maps. For the northern
parts of both the Syrias and the country of Assyria are not said to
be eastward but northward. Hence we may discern their mistake,
who will have Charran to be situate a great way towards the north
and the mountains of Armenia, about the 36th or 37th degrees of
latitude, and who confound it with Edessa, or Orfa, as R. Benjamin,
Peter Appian, Jacob Ziglerus, Joseph llloletius, and others
And the Carrae that are there marked toward the Assyria-ns,
whence Lucan called them the Assyrian Carrae, as in the book of
Tobit they are placed between Nineveh and Raghcs, are of neces-
sity altogether different from the Charran of N ahor, and Abra-
ham. Charran, therefore, in *Mesopotamia was situated bctwixt
Babylonia and that part of Syria which led into Palestine ; hence
it lies more towards the south, not far from the river Euphrates,
as the Chaldaean paraphrase hath it. The Nubian geographer
confirms this, who will have Harran to be more southerly than
the city of Aleppo, about 31 degrees north latitude. Hence
Arias Montanus, on Gen. xxiv. 10, declareth the city Padan to
be in that tract nearer to Babylonia, which more truly was the
country in which Charran the city of Nahor was situate3 nor
