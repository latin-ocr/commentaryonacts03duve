554 THE Ac'rs or THE Hom APOSTL-Es [CHAP. xxvm.

those who are bit, ‘as those do who are lying in the fire.’ It may
therefore be rendered either way in Luke. And therefore one of
the Arabics in this place has, ‘they expected that it would burn.'
And Castalio, ‘ while they expected that it should burn.’ But
Jerome, ‘they thought that he would be turned into a tumour,'
that is, that he would swell; which Arias and Beza follow, and
many other of the N eoterics. Nor without reason, seeing this is
one of the principal and most notable symptoms that. attend the
stinging of serpente, that the part stung immediately swelleth.
Dioscorides, lib. vi. saith, ‘those who are bit by a viper, their body
swells, and is exceedingly dried up.’ Nicander, speaking of those
that are stung by a viper in his Theriaca, ver. 240, saith, ‘noisome
tumours bubble up, as if the body were burnt with fire‚' So also
Paul AEgineta: ‘Blisters break forth in the part that is bitten, as
in those that are burnt.’ And AEtius writeth of a wound infiicted
by a viper: ‘that a bilious tumour ensued, very hot, full of bubbles,
somewhat red,' &c. And Avicenna, in the chapter of the Biting of
SerpentS, towards the bottom of page 137, saith: ‘Then appeareth
a hot tumour red, full of pimples and pushes as from the burning
by fire.”’ Thus far Bochart. “The learned,'> saith John Price,
‘⁶ dispute, whether the word πιμπρᾶσθαι denote a tumour or inflam-
mation ε Ι think it signifieth both. Excellent is that place of
Lucan to this purpose, and so far as Ι know, untouched,'’ lib.
ix. ver. 780, &c., thus Englished by the above-mentioned Sir A.
Gorges :—

The fiery prester (with his sting)

Nasidius to his end doth bring.

Nasidius that (with his plough-shares)

The Marsian flelds for grains prepareS.

His face is coloured fiery red.

His puffed swollen skin at large is spread.

All form and shape his looks hath lost,

The tumour so his corps imbost.

And so his veius the poison feeds,

That human measure he exceeds.

One lump doth all his parts confound,

Within a sormless body drown'd.

llis hai-bergeon was not of space,

His swollen carcase to embrace.

The boiling caldron's srothy scum,

Doth not in bubbles rise so plumb.

Nor yet the‘sail-‘doth swell so fast,

WVhen it is puff'd with windy blast.

The misshap'd corpse could scarce contain,
The limbs that soowith six-elling'strain.
