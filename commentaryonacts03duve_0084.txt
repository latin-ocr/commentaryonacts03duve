cessive to the other by any right or pretence, is altogether, Ι
confess, beyond my faith. They say that ἈΝ-1311 calls a J ew
‘dipped3’ but Ι, as his commentator does, believe that he spake
confusedly, and that he rather meant a Christian than a J ew, as in
another place hc calls the Christians, Galileans: likewise, Lubin
upon Juvenal, Sat. iii. v. 14, observes, that there, by Jews, are
meant Christiane, who being expelled the city by Domitian, were
forced to betake themselves to the woods that were sacred to
heathenish superstitions. Therefore, that I may conclude, I say
with Alexander de Hales, tinctio, that is ‘dipping,’ is the formal
cause of baptism.’' Thus far the most learned, and highly de-
serving of sacred writingS, Sir N orton Knatchbull, knight and
baronet. “Now,’' saith Grotius, “that the ancients made use of
the word tinyere instead of baptizare, is not to be wondered at,
seeing the Latin word tinqere is properly the same in signification,
and frequently used for mersare, ‘to dip or to plunge '’'

Hence it is that Magnus, in St. Cyprian, doubts whether they
are to be accounted rightly initiated Christians‚ who are only
initiated by sprinkling or pouring, in cases of sickness or weakness.
To which Cyprian answers, ‘⁶ That whatever benefit accrues by the
saving sacrament, that sprinkling, or pouring upon, necessity so
enforcing, and God indulging, affords to the believer.” ‘⁶ And this
is the sense and law of the Church of England3 not that it be
indifferent, but that all infants be dipped, except in the case of
sickness, and then sprinkling is permitted. And, therefore,
although in cases of need and char-ity, the church of England
does not want some good examples in the best times to counte-
nance that permission, yet we are to follow her command, because
that command is not only according to the meaning and intent of
the word ‘baptize,’ but agrees with the mystery of the sacrament
itself. For we are buried with lzz'm z’n baptism, saith the apostle.
The old man is buried, and drowned in the immersion under water,
and when the baptized person is listed up from the water, it
represents the resurrection of the new man to newness of life.
In this case, therefore, the contrary custom, being not only against
an ecclesiastiea] law, but against the analogy and mysterious
signification of the sacrament, is not to be eomplied with, unless
in such cases that can be of themselves sufficient to justify a
liberty in a ritual and ceremony3 that is, a case of necessity.”
Thus the learned Jeremy Taylor, bishop of Down. ¹
