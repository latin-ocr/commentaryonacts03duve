that some of this sect were sicarii. For the Hessaei did fight very
fiercely against the Romans, and rather than they would call Caesar
lord, did choose to undergo most bitter tortures, yea, made no
scruple of losing their dearest blood, and willingly gave themselves
over to death. Of these sicarii Scaliger writeth.¹ J osephus saith
that the followers of J udas, save in this that they would give no
man the title of lord, were in other points Pharisees. On the other

affirmeth that J udas of Galilee was the author of the sect of the
Essenes, who are commonly called Nazarites, that is, holy3 and
AssideanS, that is, godly. And also that it was by the instigation

his hand requiring silence.

He spake. To the people of the Jews.

In tlte Hebrew touque. Which was then in use among the Jews,
that is, the Syro-Hebraean, as appears from a great many places in the
New Testament, where several sayings of our Lord J esus and his
apostles are expressed in their mother tongue. But it seems that
Syro-Hebraean speech, or the Hebrew mixed with the Syrian
dialect, was not unknown at that time to the Jews that were dis-
persed among other nations. For seeing very many used to come
to ‚Jerusalem on days of greater solemnity, they learned that
speech that was usual in that city, which was the metropolis of all
the devm, wherever their place of abode was.
