not say that the bodies of the eleven patriarche are bu-ried in
Hebron immediately after their death, but μετὰ χρόνον, “ a time
intervening;'' yet 110 says, that Joseph’s bones only were trans-
ported ὕστερον, “afterwa1-ds,” when they were departed out of
Egypt. The interi-ing of the former, therefore, was performed
before the departure. “ Whioh‚’' saith the famous Lud. de Dieu,
“the very series of Stephen’s discourse seems to evince. For
when he had first spoken of the death of Jacob, then of the death,
transportation, and burial of the patriarehs, he subjoins, that then
the time of accomplishing the promise made to Abraham drew
near, and that the people, increased to a great number, incurred
the king’s hatred, and were by Moses, after they had suffered most
heavy affiictions, brought out of Egypt, which truly are so recited,
that they seem to have happened after the interment of the
patriarchs.”

In Sychem. Sieemus, or Sicima‚ sometime the metropolitan
city of Samaria, was situated on mount Gerizim, according to
5 osephus.1 ‘⁶ And seeing,” saith he, “he was kindly entreated by

all he came near, the Samaritans who then held the metropolis

Sicima, situate on Mount Gerizim, and> inhabited‘ by the apostates
of the Jewish nation‚ seeing that Alexander did entreat the Jews*
so magnificently, they resolved also to profess themselves 5 ews.”
Benjamin of Tudela gave them the same situati—on in his Itinerary,
by whom it is called N ebelas, that is, Neapolis, for so they called it
in his days. Pliny also, lib. v. cap. 13, makes mention of Neapolis
among the towns of Samaria, which formerly was called Mamortha,
saith he. Its name was altered from the Hebrew into a Greek
form3 for it is in the Hebrew Slzeelzem, whereof mention is made,
Gen. xxxiii„ xxxiv„ where it is declared that Simeon and Levi
the sons of Jacob, for the rape committed on their sister Dinah by
the king of Shechem's son, took it, and destroyed all the males
together with the king and his son. Afterward Abimelech, 5 udg.
ix. 45, rased it to the ground and sowed it with salt. But J ero-
boam king of Israel rebuilt it, and dwelt in it, as it is declared in
the History of the Kings, 1 Kings xii. We read, Gen, xxxiii. 19,
that Jacob purchased a parcel of land from the sons of Hamm-
the father of Shechem for a hundred kesithis, that is, sheep or
lambs. Here Joseph, whose issue obtained the propriety thereos,
is said to have been buried, Josh. xxiv. 32. In the same place
