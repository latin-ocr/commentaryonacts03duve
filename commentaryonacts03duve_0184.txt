Sayz'ny, &c He does not cite the very words which Moses,
Exod. ii. 13, is said to have spoken to him that did the wrong to his
neighbour, but he expresses the sense very well. “Fon” saith
Grotius, “there he is called ὁ πλησῖος, ‘neighbour,' who is here
called ὁ ἁδελφὸς, brother, countryman, descended of the same
ancestors.''

Hebrew, is called wicked who has an evil heart and malicious mind.
“Equity commandeth,” saith Aristotle in his book of the Art of
Oratory, “that we make a difference betwixt injuries and faults,
as also betwixt faults and misfortunes. Misfortunes are, which
can neither be provided against, nor are committed with a malicious

art, and that, indeed, the sublimest of arts.” The same master
of the church handling this subject on Eph. iii., in ‘the end, saith,
‘⁶ Thy injusticc, thy cruelty hath made me a ruler and a judge.’'

understanding by this upbraiding language that it was publicly
known that he killed, though justly, the Egyptian that wronged
the Hebrew, and fearing what might befall him, by reason thei-eof,

Hebrews as slaveS, yea, as beasts, whom they would have every
one persuaded to be incapable of injury.''
