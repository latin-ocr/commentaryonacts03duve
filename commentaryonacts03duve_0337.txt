Christ, Matt. xxiii. 8.

in these words Peter had respect to what Christ said to him,
Matt. xvi. 19, Ι will 92⁷0& mato thee the keys of the kinqdom of
heaven: which is, as he the said Lightfoot interprets it: “Thou
first shalt open the door of faith to the Gentiles.⁷’ ‘⁶ Then
the Lord chose him, that by his mouth the Gentiles might first
hear the word of the gospel, and believe3 and this he says was
done a good while age, or in the first days, that is, as he speaks
before in the first chapter, ver. 21, in the time when the Lord went

still necessary to ple-ase God, would not be rooted out of the
hearts of the believing ‹Jews3 but the reverenee of those rites of
the law, as being divinely instituted, had made sneh impression on
their minds, that it was not easy prescntly to remove them, and

his Sacred History, treating of the emperor Hadrian, saith: ⁶ That
