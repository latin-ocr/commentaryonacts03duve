translated τίειν, ‘to weigh3' Exod. xxii. 17, ἀποτῖειν, ‘ to render 3’
Isa. lv. 2, τιμᾶσθαι, ‘ to weigh.’ Anciently money was heavy brass,
which used first to be weighed, and then paid. Thence σταθμὸς,

death, of which in the foregoing chapter. So that truly, after he
once tasted the blood of the faithful, he thirsted more insatiably

after the same, and was the more provoked to lay his hands on
them.
