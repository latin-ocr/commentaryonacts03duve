Catena Patrum upon Isaiah, not yet published. ‘⁶ But also,” saith
he, “ the author of the Acts of the Apostles saith, that they who
were with him went aboard of a ship of Alexandria, whose sign
was Castor and Pollux. For it is usual for Alexandrian ships to
have such ensigns painted on the right and left side of their fore-
castle.” Moreover, we may observe that Paul did not refuse in
case of necessity to make use of that ship, which has the image of
an idol upon it. For seeing an idol hath no virtue to pollute things
consecrated to it, a Christian making use of these things in case of
necessity, where there is no just cause of offence, is not defiled, if
they be referred to civil uses. See 1 Cor. viii. 4, 7 -10.

“ It was,” saith Thomas de Pinedo, ‘⁶ of old divided into four parts,
according to Cicero, in Verrem, lib. iv. One, which Strabo calls
Ortygia, (lib. vi.) was by them called Nasos (that name in the
Doric dialect, which the Syracusians used, signifies an island),
famous for two harbourS, and the royal palace of Hieron, where
the praetors had their residence. In this part of the city there
were many consecrated temples, two whereof surpassed the rest,
to wit, Diana’s temple, and Minerva’s. There was also a fountain
of sweet water, whose name was Arethusa, of incredible largemss,
celebrated not only by poeth, but also by prose writers, very full of
fish, which would have been wholly covered with the* waveS, had it
not been parted from the sea by a fortified wall and certain heaps
of stones. The second part was called Acradina, wherein were a
very large market-place, stately galleries, a public hall extraordinary
