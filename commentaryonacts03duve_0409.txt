that proverb, ‘⁶ It is not every one that may sail to Corinth.'’ But
the Corinthians were always much addicted to whores, esteeming
this so far from being base, that they were admitted to their public
pmyers, and it was a part of their prayer, that the gods would
increase their number and their income. Some also vowed to
bring in more of them, as we have it from Athenaeus and AElian.
There Lais exacted the tribute of her lust of all Greece, prosti-

had a tomb made famous with the verses of all the poets. And
hence it is that “to play the Corinthian,⁷’ is commonly among the
Greeks “ to whore.” And a Corinthiam maid, with Plato, is one
that prostituteth herself. The scholiast of St. Gregory of
N azianzen, upon his first oration against Julian, notes that there
were always some most famous at Corinth. AElian also saith,
that the Corinthians were drunkards. Pride useth to accompany

was always their language‚ “the Corinthian born of Jupiter will
not suffer these things.” This their pride, when it had puffed
them up even to contemn the Roman name, brought ruin upon
them, L. Mummus having vanquished them. But the city being
repaired by Julius Caesar, as Strabo and Diodorus Siculus in his
Fragments, saith, in a very short time, as their riches returned to
them, so did their vices. The studies of philosophy of old flou-
rished there, Periander, prince of the city, being reckoned among
the seven wise men of Greece, and Diogenes, the great dei-ider of
the opinions received among men, being much conversant there.
