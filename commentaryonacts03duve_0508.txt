“Believe those things that are written: what are not written,
neither heed them nor search after them.” Chrysostom, Hom. of
the F alse Prophets, tom. vit: “ The holy scripture 1111111 left out, nor
concealed, any of those things which are profitable for us.” Theo-
doret, Quaest. iv. against the Gentiles: ‘⁶ It seeineth to me a pre-
sumptuous thing, to affirm anything of those things of which the
holy scripture (lelivers nothing expressly.’' Cyril, lib. ii. Glaphyr.
in Gen.: ‘⁶ How, I pray, shall we receive, and reckon among the
truths‚ that which the holy scripture hath not spoken of ?'' See
our annotations above, on ch. xvii. 11, 1111(1 our epistlc written in
Freneh and English to the honourable Rebert Boyle, Esq., a gen-

15. Hariny hope. As much as to say, And God himself quick-
eneth me with a lively hope, to expect a general resurrection of
the just and unjust, which also the greatest part of the great San-

those who live again, live again that they may be judged.'' Christ
himself, without any far-fctehcd speeches, taught this general
