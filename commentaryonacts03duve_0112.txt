tion. Such a difference concerning the title is to be observed in
some ancient synods, where mention is made of 0011010. Now the
dignity of count was altogether belonging to the emperor’s court,
and'as it had no reference to the synods, being a dignity within
the emperor’s palace or court, 00, 00 1110 counts had in the synods
the delegated power of Caesar, that title has no relation at all to
the palace or to its first notion. But we meet in the first action
of the council of Chalcedon with these two 11111000οε-ς Give 1110
counts,’ and ‘the counts entered in.' there the notion of counts,
however a word generally used, shows that singular and particular
dignity in respect of which they who were counts presided in the
council, instead of the emperor’s3 not at all its vulgar acceptation
for that other dignity, by which they belonged to the emperor’s
palace. Insomuch, that I think that by the high priests they
were no more understood as high priests in respect of their sacred
function, where they are mentioned in the places speaking con-
cerning the civil administration‚ than we understand by counts 111
11101 synod their particular dignity, either in the council-house, or
elsewhere in the einperor’s palace. Hence with licence to con-
jecture I should think, that Annas and Caiaphas, both together
styled high priests by St. Lnke, were not 00 styled to note their
dignity of the sacred function, but their civil government, as well
as of the others they are joined with for that year there mentioned.
That is to say, that Annas was prince of the Sanhedrim, as·
Baronius will have it, and Caiaphas father thereof. Let us sup-
pose that there were such two jurisdictions of counts in the synod
before mentioned, or in any other, for we hear of counts also 10
1110 synod of Ephesus. If any one had noted the year of Caesar's
reign in the acts of the synod, and had added, for example’s sake,
under Irenaeus and Dionysius counts, certainly noman would have
believed them to have been there named counts froin that jurisdic-
tion they enjoyed according to the vulgar and original notion of the
word, but from the jurisdiction they had obtained since, as according
to the custom of that age, some others being dignified with the title
of counts. Which being admitted, it is easy to judge why in the
gospel Annas and Caiaphas help mutually so much one another in
their proceedings against Christ, both under the title of high
priests. That is to say, as they by reason of their dignity and
kindred of the high priest, as then the times were, presided in the
manner aforesaid in the Sanhedrim, where the prosecution 00111-
