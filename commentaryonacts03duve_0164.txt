imagines, or making a relapse unto his old idolatry, as others
allege, tarried at Charran, and would not accompany his son, is as
like a fiction as may be. Nor are we much moved with Petavius's,
Bonfrerius’s, and Harvilleus’s argumentS, by which they would
evince that Abraham dwelt at Charran several years. F irst, say
they, Stephen saith Abraham dwelt in Charran, Κατοικῆσαι ἐν
Χαῤῥὰν. But it is probable, that by the word dwelt, some years
are denoted. Secondly, Abraham is said, Gen. xii. 5, to have
qotten souls, that is, to have purchased slaves, beasts, and cattle,
whereby his goods were increased. Now in purchasing these, and
gathering them together, there must of necessity several years be
spent. Thirdly, Abraham called Charran his own land, Gen.
xxiv. 4. But he would not have called it his own land, if he had
not dwelt in it for some years. For who would call that his own
land which he only passed over? These arguments have no
solidity in them. Not the first3 for let us suppose that Terah and
Abraham departed from Ur of the Chaldeans toward the latter
end of the spring, and that Terah⁷s sickness interrupting them,
they continued there all the summer and winter following, and
then that Abraham again parted from Charran in the beginning of
the next spring; was not -the interval of time long enough, that
he might be said to have dwelt there? So he who hires a house
for six months, although a lesser time, is yet no less said to have
dwelt there, than he who has continued his habitation in it for six
years. And the Hebrew word mg), as also the Chaldaic :ht-53, sig-
nifies not only “to dwell,'’ but also “to sit ;'’ so that the shortest
stay in a place is enough to say these words of an inhabitant.
Not the second, for there is no necessity why we should rather
understand Moses of gathering together riches, slaves, and cattle
brought forth in his house, than of procuring by emption slaves,
cattle, and other things, whereby his patrimony left by his father
might be increased. And this acquisition, in how small a time
might it be performed? Not the third, for neither does Abraham
call Charran his own land, but Aram N aharaim, or Mesopotamia,
as appears, Gen. xxiv. 4, compared with ver. 10. But not
Charran only was in Mesopotamia, but also Ur of the Chaldeans,
as we have shown above.

And from thence, &c. Terah, Abraham's father is said to have
lived two hundred and five yearS, when he died at Chal-ran, Gen.
xi. 32. But Abraham, whom Stephen here saith plainly not to
