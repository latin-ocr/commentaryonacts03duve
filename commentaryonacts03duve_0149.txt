Also the examples which Gamaliel produceth are true. Now
whereas Gamaliel feared that they should fight against God, that
came afterward to pass3 which, if they had followed his advice, had
never been.” And a little after, “ Whereas Calvin saith that this
advice of Gamaliel's is such as would overthrow all politica] order,
and enervate church discipline, he saith not true3 for the dis-
cipline of the apostles was not quite without nerves, though it had
no such nerves as Calvin speaks. Also political order is in force in
sins that are certain, and without controversy. In the law ot
Moses the seventy elders judged -in smaller and more easy causes,
and brought the more hard and difficule to Moses, and he consulted
with God concerning them. So may it also be done now. Adultery,
manslaughter, false witness, and other certain and known crimes,
may without hazard be judged. But for heretics the matter is
controvertcd (for if it were not controverted, it would not be
debated any more than murder), and therefore to be referred to
‘she oracle. Therefore as Moses waited the time of the oracle, and
yet did not in the meanwhile overthrow the political order, so we
are to wait the time of God’s judgment, which will be a certain
oracle in this controversy. Yet God in the meantime will make
use of the service of his ministers in things not controverted.''

of the sermon preached before the House of Lords, on Nov. 5th,
Α 168οτ “Of societies of men, Christians of all others are most
averse from ways of violence and blood, especially from using any
such ways upon the account of religion: and among Christian
churches, where they differ among themselves, if either of them
use these ways upon the account of religion, they give a strong
presumption against themselves that they are not truly Cln·i„stians.”
Thus far the Right Rcvercnd Bishop of St. Asaph, William Lloyd,
a man of excellent parts, great erudition, singular piety and be-
nignity, to whom I do, and shall all my lifetime acknowledge myself
to be extremely bound. ‘⁶ We do not,'’ says Gregory Nazianzen,¹
“ brand our enemies with reproaches as many do, covering the
weakness of their reasons and arguments with foul language, as is
said of the cuttle fish, that it vomits its ink in the water to escape
