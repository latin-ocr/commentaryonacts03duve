should suffer pains, straits, reproaches, finally a violent death, and
shameful punishment3 but when they did know for a certainty by
the predictions of the prophets, that both the highest honours
were prepared for him, and the greatest power, and a kingdom
also, they do suppose they can marvellously well prevent the
discrepancy of the prophecies, in which the two comings of Christ
are predicted—the one humble and base, the other noble and
honourable—-if so be they can devise two Messiahs: the one to
come of that ancient «Ioseph, the son of Jacob by Rachel, which
Messiah should be called Nehemias, the son of Uziel; that this
should be unhappy, and appointed to miseries and a bloody death,
in fighting against the wicked and monstrous Arinillus: that the
other should spring of the lineage of David, and be the restorer
of the kingdom of Israel, and abound in glory, and gather the
dispersed in Israel, by whom the Messiah son of Joseph, is to be
raised unto life again, after that God hath discomfited Armillus,
and all Armillus's army, with fire and brimstone sent down from
heaven. ‘⁶ This doctrine,’' says Huetius, eminent in every sort of
learning, “ is delivered in the sixth book of the second part of the
Talmud, which is concerning the feast of tabernacles, ch. v. ; and
the same doctrine is found both in Bereschith Babba, and in R.
David Kimchi, and Aben Ezra, and R. Makir in his Aromatic
Powder, and in a great many later rabbins. In which it is mar-
vellous to think how great an error hath deceived them. There
is prophesied one Messiah’s two comings3 they look for two
Messiahs’ one coming. Of the which fiction of theirs, if any shall
inquire a reason from them, they will either give none or a foolish
one. They allege these words of Isa. xxxii. 20, Blessed are με
that saw beside all waters, that send forth tltz'tlzer tlte feet qf tlte oa·
(md the ass. They expound that sowing to be money given to the
poor, which who shall give, they say he is worthy of Elias, and
both the Messiahs. They think Elias is noted by the word
immittentes, “ that send forth,’' because it is written in Mal. iv. 5,
Beltold Iwz‘ll send Elias tlte prophet. They expound the foot of the
ox to be the lNIessiah that is to come of Joseph, because Moses
being near to death spake of Joseph, Dent. xxxiii. 17, His beazcty
is like the flrstlz'nq qf his bulloek: but they expound the ass to be
the Messiah son of David, whom Zecharias did predict, ch. ix. 9,
that he should be poor, and carried on a she-ass. It is tedious to
me to rehearse those trifies, which notwithstanding are to be found
