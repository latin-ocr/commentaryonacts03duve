rolled down upon him with violence. And if there was life still
left in him, all the people stoned him.” Talmud Hieros. fol. 23, 1,
Babyl. Sanhed. fol. 42, 2, “ The place of stoning was without the
council house, according to that of Lev. xxiv. 14, ‘ Carry out the
blasphemous person without the camp.' Tradition, The place of
stoning was without the three camps. Glossary. The court was
the camp of divine presence, the mountain of the temple, the
camp of the Levites: Jerusalem, the camp of the Israelites.’'
R. Moses Maimonides, in the treatise of the Edifice of the temple,
c. ’.7, n. 7, saith, ‘⁶ There were three sorts of camps in the wilder-
ness, that of the Israelites, which was divided into four partitions3
that of the Levites, of which mention is made Num. i. 50, And
shall eneump round about the tabernacle ,· and that of God, without
the gate of the court, in the tabernacle of the covenant.'' And in

treatise of the manner of going up to the temple, c. 3, num. 2,
hath most learnedly noted: ‘⁶ That that is true, we may learn from
the apostle, who in the last chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
ver. 11, 12, 13, speaketh thus: For the bodies of those beasts, whose
blood is brouylzt into the sanctuary by the hifsh prz‘estfor siu, are bur-ned
without the camp. therefore Jesus also, that he mz’qlzt sanctg'fy the
people with his own blood, suffered without the φατε. Let us yo forth
therefore unto him without the camp, beariny his reproach.”

And the witnesses. To wit, that they might be in readiness to
cast the first stone, according as the law enjoined, Deut. xvii. 7,
“Although therefore,'' saith Beza, “all these things were done
tumultuously, and that not without violation of the governor of
the province's authority, yet they would seem to do nothing but
what the law of God enjoined them. «Iosephus, Antiq. xx. 8,
declareth that while Albinus Festus's successor governed Judea,
Ananias the high priest with the like boldness caused James, the
brother of the Lord, to be stoned3 on the account of which wicked-
ness the priesthood was taken from him, and conferred on one
