thinks to the last branch. Why it was fit to write in this case to
the converted Gentiles, viZ., because otherwise, unless it were
expressly declared unto them that they were freed from keeping
the rituals of the law, they may think themselves still bound
thereunto, since they use to be present in the synagogues of the
J eWS, where the law of Moses, in which the same are strictly
commanded, use to be publicly read every sabbath day. Chrysos-
tom conceives J ames here intended to assign a reason, why there
was no such reason for writing of this matter to the Jews that
had embraced the saith of Christ, as there was to the new—believing
Gentiles, because the former might well enough know their duty
from the law, which according to ancient custom was read unto
them every sabbath in their synagogues. ‘⁶ What (says he¹) is the
meaning of this? I judge as much as I say with authority, that we
ought to write to them, that they abstain from things offered to
idols, and fornication, and what is strangled, and from blood.
For these, though corporal things, are yet necessary to be observed,
because they occasion great evils. And lest any should object,
and why should we not write the same things to the Jews? he

but the contrary. For it should have been a great shame for the
instructors, anda superfluous burden.'’ Hugo Grotius takes the
sense of this verse to be thus : “For as to Moses, those which are
of the Jews cannot complain that he is contemned by the Gentiles
of our religion. Since Moses is read in our assemblies no less
than in those of the Jews, as from ancient times has been accus-
tomed, and that too on the sabbath days.'' But to me the inter-
pretation of Cui-cellaeus seems most genuine and probable, since
those given by Chrysostom and Grotius look more strained.

The Greek word κηρύσσειν, which is translated “to preach,’'
