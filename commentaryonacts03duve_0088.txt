not add, and of the Holy Ghost nor in the name of the Father,
because he is not there named. But if they were commanded to
be baptized in the name of Christ, though the Father and the Holy
Ghost were not mentioned, yet we understand that they were not
otherwise baptized than in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost3 why, dost thou not apprehend, when it is said of the Son,
all tlzz'nys were made by ltz'm, that the Holy Ghost also, though not

mentioned, is there likewise understood?” Thus St. Austin. “Cer- ,

tainly,'’ saith Facundus, bishop of Hermia,l “the apostles baptized
in the name of J esus, though not only of the Lord Jesus, that
is, in the name of the Son only, but also of the F ather and H oly
Ghost. And from hence, I gather, that when baptism was cele-

Bonaventure,³ “As the royal letters, scaled with the king's seal, are
of high dignity, power, and value, and are said to do great things,
yet there 15 not in them any absolute force, but only an ordain-
ment through the efficacy of the royal power3 the same thing is to
be understood of the sacrament-s. And thus speak the texts of the
holy fathers according to common acceptation.⁷’

And ⁴ye shall receive tlte qfft qf tlte Holy Spirit. That is, ye shall
be indued with the prophetie spirit, a specimen of which ye saw in
the diversity of languages. ‘⁶ For,” saith Calvin, “this place ought
not to be understood of the grace of sanctification, which is gene-
rally conferred upon all the godly.'' According to the usual Hebrew
phrase, the Prophetic 'Spirit is called the Holy Spirit, which by
