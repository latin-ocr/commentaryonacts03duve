ΤΙιαιι Paul and Barnabas. Who were as one party in this con-
troversy. It is credible that Paul, when it was thus decreed by
the church of Antioch that he should go to Jerusalem, was admo-
nished by revelation, that he should altogether do what the church
had appointed3 for Paul, Gal. ii. 2, speaking of this his journey,
saith, that he went up to Jerusalem by revelation.

And certain others of them. That is, of thom who urged the
necessity of circumcision. Concerning which matter the Jews
themselves were not altogether agreed. For when¹ Izates, king of
the Adiabene, being instructed in the religion of tho Jews by one
Ananias, thought he could not be a perfect J ew unless he were
circumcised, his tutor dissuaded him therefrom, saying, ‘⁶ That he

flourishing, had more rigid sentiments in this matter than those
whom the sense of calamities hath since humbled and rendered
less apt to censure3 for these dare not deny all participation of
bliss to the Gentiles in the life to come, though still they esteem
that they shall be as much more happy than all other people, as
the Gibeonites of old were inferior to them in the land of Canaan3
whence arose their murmuring against Christ, when in the parable,
Matt. xx„ he seemed to equal the Gentiles with them.
