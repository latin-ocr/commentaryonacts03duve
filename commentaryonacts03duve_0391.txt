Rome, and afterward the Caesars who transferred to themselves
the government of the people of Rome, suffered none in the
provinces subject to their governlnent, of which Macedonia at that
time was one, to be called king without their own permission.
“ A great and odious crime,’' saith Calvin, “yet too impudently
forged. Paul and Silas sought to erect the kingdom of Christ,
which is spiritua13 the Jews knew well that this might be done
without any iujury to the Roman empire. They knew that they
meant nothing less than to overthrow the public state, or to
deprive Caesar of his authority3 the Jews therefore maliciously
catch at this pretence that they might procure hatred to these
innocents. The Macedonians had no such respect for religion,
much less for the J ewish, that for its cause they should forthwith
drag persons unknown to the slaughter3 the Jews, therefore, catch
at the pretence of treason to oppress these innocents with the
odiousness of that crime alone. Neither doth Satan cease to this
day to spread such mists before rnen's dazzled eyes. The papists
know very well, and are sufficiently convinced before God, that it
is more than false which they lay to our charge, that we overthrow
all civil government, that laws and judgments are taken away, that
the power of kings is subverted by us And yet they are not
ashamed to the end they may make the whole world to hate us,
falsely to report us to be enemies to public order. For wc must
note that the Jews not only allege that Caesar's commands were
violated, because Paul and Silas durst presume to innovate some—
what in religion, but because they said there was another king.
This crime was altogether forged. Moreover, if at any time reli-
gion force us to resist tyrannical edicts, which forbid us to give due
honour to Christ, and due worship to God, we may then justly say
for ourselves that we do not violate the power of kings. For they
are not so exalted that they may endeavour, like giants, to pull
God out of his throne. That excuse of Daniel's was true, that he
had not offended the king, while yet he obeyed not his wicked
commandment, neither had injured mortal man, because he had
preferred God to him. So let us faithfully pay to princes their
tributes, let us be ready to any civil obedience, but if not content
with that degree, they would pluck out of our hands the fear and
worship of God, there is no reason why any should say we despise
them, because we make more account of the power and majesty of
God.”
