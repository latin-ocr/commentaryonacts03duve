No man may deliver me anto them. That is, no man bath power
to grant this liberty to the Jews to judge me against my will.
“ It was‚” saith Grotius, “ contrary to the Roman laws to deliver
up a Roman citizen, and that against his will to men of a province,
to be judged by them.” Pliny, in his epistle to TraJan, of the
Christians saith, ‘⁶ There were others possessed with the like mad-
ness, whom, because they were Roman citizens, Ι ordered to be
sent back into the city.’'

I appeal unta Coesar. That is, as Grotius interprets it, ‘⁶ If ye
will deliver me to be judged by the Sanhedrim (for Festus seemed
