23. Your devotz‘ons. The word in the Greek signifieth “those
deities which are worshipped.’'

I found cm altar. The word βωμὸς in the Greek- bible and
fathers, and ara in the vulgate Latin translation of the bible and
the Latin fathers, is used only of an altar erected for the honour
of idols, seeing the altar erected under the Old Testament for
worshipping the true God is constantly and always called &vo-cao·-
τήριον in Greek, and altare in Latin. One table was went to be
placed in the midst of every meeting place of the primitive Chris-
tians, upon which every one laid what he bestowed for the use of
the poor, as we are informed by Theodoret 3¹ and because alms are
noted with the name of sacrifice, that table upon which they were
laid was called by the ancient Christians an· altar. Heb. xiii. 10.
This table also was appointed for the use of the Lord's supper,
and hence it came to pass, that by little and little, they which did
partake of the bread and wine of the Lord’s supper at this table,
which, for the alms laid upon it, was called an altar, were said to
have partaken of the altar. Of this table Paul speaks, 1 Cor. x.
18, and Athanasius, in his Epistle to Solitary Livers. This also
is to be observed, that when Christians, in the time of Constantine
the Great, did begin to build sumptuous churches to God, then
also in place of that one wooden table, almost in every church of
God, there was one of stone erected, which yet served for the
same use, that the wooden table did before.

With this inscrzption, To tlte unknown God. The God of the
Jews was by the Gentiles called unknown, because he had no
name by which they knew him. It was not lawful commonly to
pronounce the sacred name of Πῂι-ῐζ, by which the Jews called
him. Hence he is called by Lucan, in his second book of the
Pharsaliam VVar, the “ uncertain God.'' By Trebellius Pollion, in
the Life of Claudius, “Moses’ uncertain Deity.” By the Ethnics
in Justin Martyr, in his Paraencsis to the Greeks, “altogether
hidden.” ssy Caius Caligula in Philo,ss “the unnamed God.” And
by Isaiah the prophet himself, ch. xlv. 15, A Gosl that lzideclz him-
self. “As the inhabitants of Mount Carmel in Tacitus,³ gave
neither an image, nor a temple to this God, but only an altar and
rever-enee, so also,’' saith Usher, “the Athenians (lid place their
altar of piety in the middle of their town without any image, as
Statius saith in the twelfth book of his Thebaidss’ The author ot’
