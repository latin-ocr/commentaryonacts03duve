4. Jolm verz‘ly. Famous Solonion Glassius:¹ “ These adversative
conjunctionS‚ μὲν, ‘verily,’ ‘indeed,’ ‘truly,’ and δὲ, ‘but,' do in
speech mutually follow one another, and necessarily one another as
mutual correlativeS, Matt. iii. 11, Ι indeed baptize wz'tlz water unco
repentcmce; but he that eometlz after me, &c. 3 ch. ix. 37, The
harvest truly is plenteous, but tlte labourers are few. And thus the
scripture speaketh in many other places. See the Concordances
of the New Testament. Hence it appears that Acts xix. 4, 5,
the words are connected together, and hold out one continued
discourse of Paul's, connected by these particles μὲν and δὲ.
Then said Paul, John, μὲν, ‘ verily,' baptized with the baptism of
repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe
on him, who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus3
Ἀκουσαυτές δε, but those> that heard this (John’s report of Christ)
they were baptized (by John) in the name of the Lord J esus.
The fifth verse then expresseth not Paul⁷s act or any rebaptizing,
but it follows in the sixth verse concerning Paul’s act, that he
laid his hands on those disciples, &c., compare ch. viii. lat—17.
Bellarmine calls this explanation, however, witty: yet nowise pious
nor probablc. But why is it neither pious nor probable‘? John’s
baptism is mentioned in ver. 4, therefore it were superfluous to
repeat it, ver. 5. This is the strength of the argument, but it is
no superfluous repetition. For he first sets forth John’s entire
ministry in general, which consists in the baptism of repentance,
which phrase includes both the administration of the sacrament
’ itself, and the preaching of repentance. Compare Mark i. 4.
Afterward he more particularly expresseth the order of his
niinistry, that first he inculcated faith in Christ, and then his
auditors being informed of Christ, he baptized them in the name
of Jesus.”

Baptized with the baptism of repentance.. That is, when he stirred
up the people to repentance; to them who confessed their sins and
sincere conversion and amendment of life, he was the first that
administered baptism, which is the symbol of repentance. See
Matt. iii. 2, 5, 6, et seq.
