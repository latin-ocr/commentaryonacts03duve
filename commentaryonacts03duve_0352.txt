understood of the Christian congregations, as J ames ii. 2.
Theophilus of Antioch speaks thus: “ Synagogues, which we call
churches.''

Every sabbath day. It was the ancient manner of the Christians
(which amongst the Moscovites or Russians, the Syrians, and
Melchites, and Abyssines, yet continues) to meet together no less
on the sabbath days, commonly called Satur-days, than on the
Lord's days, vulgarly called Sundays. So the author of the
Constitutions Apostolical, under the name of Clement, bishop of
Rome, lib. vii.‚ cap. 23, enjoins: ‘⁶ The sabbath day and the Lord’s
day keep ye festivals, or holy‚ because that is dedicated to the
memory of the creation, this of the resurrection.” Constantine
the Great, as Eusebius witnesses in his Life, lib. iv., cap. 18,
ordained: ‘⁶ That all who lived in the Roman empire should, on
the days called by the name of our Lord, rest from all work, and
should also in like manner keep holy the sabbath days.” Gregory
N yssen, in his oration against those that took reprool's unkindly:
“With what eyes canst thou behold the Lord’s day, who hast
despised the sabbath? Dost thou not know that these days are
brethren? So that, if thou undervaluest. one thou offendest the
other.” Asterius, bishop of Amasea, in his Homily of Divorce:
“ The joining together and concourse of these two days is famous
amongst Christiane, of the sabbath, I mean, and. the Lord's day,
which in a circle returning time brings about every week, For as
mothers and nurses of the church they both assemble the people,
and cause the priests to sit down together to teach them, and so
both lead and impel, as well the disciples as their teachers, to the
care of souls.'’ Socrates in his History, lib. 10, cap. 22, witnesseth ε
“ That all the churches everywhere throughout the world do, as
duly as the Weeks come about, celebrate the divine mysteries on
the sabbath day, except only the church of Rome, and that of
Alexandria.” And in his sixth book, and eighth chapter, speaking
of the tumults which the Arians stirred up at Constantinople in
the time of John Chrysostom, he saith, ‘⁶ When the feasts of every
week came, to wit, the sabbath and the Lord’s day, in which
assemblies used to be held in the churches,” &c Sozomen, lib. vii.‚
cap. 19: ‘⁶ Sume meet together on the sabbath day, and likewise on
the first day of the week, as at Constantinople, and amongst most
other Christians. But at Rome and Alexandria they do not do
so.'’ Anastasius of Nice: “ The sabbath and the Lord’s day are
days holy and festival. Neither is it lawful on them to fast.'’
