Angelics, so called, because they did worship angels religiously,
whom the apostle rebukes, Col. ii. 18. The which heresy, Theo-
doret writes, that it did arise in the apostles' time, on the cited
place of the blessed Paul: and that the thirtieth canon of the
council of Laodicea, is to be understood concerning the same
heretics, who in the same country of Asia did build oratories to
St. hlichael the archangel. From him did also proceed the Colly-
ridians, who did worship Christ's mother with divine honour ; wit-
ness Epiphanius. Simon did say that how many soever believed in
him, do not fear the threats of the law, but act whatsoever they act
as freemen: for they were not to obtain salvation by good works,
but by grace. Theodoret declareth that of him in his Abridgment of
Heresies. It is manifest, out of Origen’s book against Celsus, that
the disciples of Simon did deny Jesus to be the Son of G0d3 and
the same Origen, in his sixth book against Celsus, testifies unto us
that he did shun martyrdom, and without difference worship idols.
The same Simon is reported to have had fora companion of his
crimes one Selene, that is, the moon, or as others call her Helen,
a harlot of Tyre, whom after he had taken out of the custom-house,
that he might commend her to all, as Numa Pompilius his Egeria,
116 did call her goddess, the Holy Spirit, and divine good pleasure,
and did affirm that of her he did beget angels, and that the Trojan
war in time past was undertaken for her, who is that lost sheep
whom 116 came down from heaven for to seek, having disguised
his form of god, that the angels that are over every one of the
heavens might not know him. Let the belief of all these, and
other things, which are reported of Simon, lie upon the authors'
credit.

sent thither from Jerusalem.

Testg'fied, ancl prenested tlze word qs God. As if he should say,
After they had faithfully uttered what things they had learned from
our Lord Christ, that the sure authority of the gospel doctrine,
preached by Philip the deacon, might continue, and flourish, as a
well-witnessed and authentioal verity. Hence it is manifest there-
fore, that not only Peter and John came down to Samaria, from
Jerusalem, that they might enrich the Samaritans with the gifts of
the Holy Spirit, but also that they might establish them in the

saith they had even now received, by approving of the doctrine of
Philip.
