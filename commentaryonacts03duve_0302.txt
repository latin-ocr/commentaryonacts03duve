WVest‚ famous for the Temple of Venus, to see which Vespasian
longed, Tacitus saith.¹

A false prophet. That is, falsely boasting himself to be a
prophet.

Wllose meme was ijesus. Greek Βαρϊησοῦς, Seeing this
wicked man is said to have been a J ew, the etymology of this
word must be taken from the Hebrew tougue. It is therefore the
conjecture of the most famous Ludovicus de Dieu, that this
impostor’s name was rip-nm* *1:1, Βαρϊησοῦα, and with a very small
alteration Βαρϊησοῦς, which the Arabian hath literally expressed
out of the Greek, 0³0⁸* usn, “the son of health 3 '² because he pro-
fessed the art of procuring health and soundness. So in the
Syriae he is called mmm τι, “ the son of ulcers ;'' that is, a phy-
sician that professcd to cure ulcers3 for mmm, signifies only such a
tumour as is incident to ulcers and old sores.

7. lez'clz was with the cleputy. The word ἀνθύπατος, properly
signifieth a proconsul, 01· the vicar of the Roman consul, who
governed the province as a deputy. But seeing that he, who
governed Cyprus, was not proconsul, but vice-praetor, here is a
catachresis, or abuse of the word. “Buff saith Grotius, ‘⁶ it is
no wonder that the Greeks, being great flatterers, gave the most
honourable title to the governors of their provinces. The name
of president is general, which may be here used in the Latin.’'

8. Elymas. There are many derivations and significatione of
this name. ‘⁶ To us it seems,⁷’ saith Ludovicus de Dieu, “that
Ελύμας is a Hebrew or Chaldaic name, Νηπέττ, ‘a hcaler, or a
curer,' from nbi-r, ‘to cure,’ in which sense it is taken, not only
among the Hebrews, but also frequently among the Syrians, nor
(loth it differ from rumn- Ἦ, ‘ the son of health,’ and ⁸7:³12> Ὃ, ‘ the
son of hoils,' of which above, ver. 6. N either is it unusual to
render the letter Π of a most hard aspiration by e, such are *star-r,
Ἐυώχ, rin-r, Εὔα, &c., nor to change the let-ter Ν into ‘ ηεξ such
as ΝὉΝΓΙ, Θωμᾶς, ΝΞΞἾΞ, Βαρυαβᾶς, ΝΞΝἾΠ, Βαραββᾶς.”

Soreerer. Or magician. The Persian name magi, and magician‚
for sorcery and sorcerers, not evil in themselves, are applied by an
abuse to marvellous but wicked arts, wrought by the help of
devils, and to those that are given to such arts. See our literal

explication on Matt. ii. l.
