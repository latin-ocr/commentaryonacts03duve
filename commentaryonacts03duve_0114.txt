that the two names of those by whose hands in former times
their oral law was delivered, are so to be understood in the
solemn numbering of them, that the one denotes the prince, the
other the father of the Sanhedrim. So that it is no new thing to
believe that these two were more particularly joined than the rest,
and were named together in matters of great moment. And
frequently among the Talmudists mention is made of Ezra, and of
such others with their Sanhedrim, in the management of business,
as if then they were customarily to be taken for princes of the
Sanhedrim.” Thus far the learned Selden.

And John. Whom Lightfoot conjectures to have been the
famous J ochanan Ben Zaccai the priest,¹ who is said to have lived
a hundred and twenty years3 and forty years before the destruc-
tion of «Jerusalem, when the gates cf the temple opened of them-
selves, is reported to have saicl,² ‘⁶ O temple, why dost thou disturb
thyself, Ι know thou shalt be destroyed, for so Zechariah has
prophesied: Opem thy doors, Ο Lebmzon, that the fire may devom·
thy eeclars, Zech. xi. 1.'⁷ “After the destruction of Jerusale1n,”
saith Lightfoot,3 “he got leave of Titus, that J abneh might receive
and retain the Sanhedrirn. There he presided himself two or five
years, for the certain number is disputed.”

And as many as were of the kindred os the priests In the Greek,
“of the high priest,’' as the common English translation hath, and
the Syriac and Arabio version also. That is, ‘⁶ whose ancestors,”
saith Grotius, “not long before cnjoyed the high priesthood,
which great nobility caused them to be admitted into the great
Sanhedri1n.’'

7. By what power. As much as to say, By whose effectual
virtue, or by whose command and authority have ye enred this
person lame from his mother's womb?

8. Filled with the Holy Ghost. That is, moved and excited by
a certain inspiration of the Holy Spirit, according to the promise
of Christ, Matt. x. 19, 2ος Luke xxi. 14, 15, who promised his
apostles, that when they wcre brought before presidents, kings,
and magistrateS, that utterance and wisdom should be given to
thern, which all their adversaries should not be able to withstand3
for that they should not speak themselveS, but the Spirit of the
Father should spcak within them.

9. If. This particle is here put for ‘⁶ since,” or “ seeing that.’'
