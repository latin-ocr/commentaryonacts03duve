VER, v,] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 521

Lydia, and of Pacatiana the southerly, on the east Pamphylia, on
the south the Rhodian sea,'’ saith Frid. Spanheim, in his Introduc-
tion to Sacred Geography. Resides, Stephan. Mela testifies¹ that
this province had its name froin King Lycus, son to Pandion.
The monster ohimaera was seigned to be on Cragus, the most
famous mountain of this country, which frequently casts up fire,
as AEtna, of Sicily, doeS, which the father of poets graphically
describes, Il. vi. ver. 181, which description Lucretius has thus
imitated, lib. viii.
Α lion's head, a dragon's tail, its middle the chimaera itself.

VVhere Lucretius has imitated, and rendered more to the life
Homer’s description, than ovid, Metam. vi.

On whose tops chimera fed, her parts who takes,
Middle of buck, upper from lion, tail of snakes.

That mountain gave occasion to the poets of seigning this monster,
in whose top lions abode, in its middle goatS‚ at bottom of it
serpentS, whose fable they applied to love, which invadeth one as a
lion3 nor doth it leave one till lust be satisfied‚ which the goat,
being a libidinous animal, represented), but in the end it leaveth
the bitter sting of remorse‚ which is like to the biting of a serpent.
They fable that this monster was killed by Bellerophon, whose
description see in Strabo, lib. xiv„ and Ptolemy‚ lib. v. cap. 3.
Stephanus makes mention of another Lycia, by Cilicia, “in
which‚’' saith he, “Sarpedon reigned-’⁹ But Strabo, lib. xii„
where he mentions two sorts of Lycians, placeth neither of them
near Cilicia. For he calls the one of them TroiCS, and the other
inhabitants of a country near Caria. “ Moreover, the two sorts of
people called by the name of Lycians, give grounds to suspect that
the same nation, either of the Troics or of those that dwelt upon
the borders of Caria, sent colonies into the other so called.''
Eustathius declareth the same.‘-' It is probable that Virgil speaks
of Troic Lycia (AEn. iv. ver. 143), when he saith :—

Returning from cold Lycia, so appears
Phoebus, when he to native Delia goes.

But Servius knew nothing of Troic Lycia, nor of that of Cilicia,
and he interprets that of Lycia, absolutely so called, as also does
La Cerda. Lycian arrows and quivers are also made mention of

by the poetS, of which sec the same author on Virgil's sEneid,
lib. vii. ver. 814.

Her roya] habit wondering to behold,
Her tresses plaited with a jem of gold.
Then how her Lycian quiver she did bear.
