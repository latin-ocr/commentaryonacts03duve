dead, it signifies that with their own eyes they saw Christ when
116 was risen.

16. And throzcffh saith, &c. As much as to say, and through a
firm persuasion of the divine power of JeSUS, this man whom we
see, and knew to have been lame from his mother's womb, now
upward of forty years of age, 1165 obtained from Christ the sound-

ness of his soles and ankles.
Has made this man stronq. By the consolidatian of his feet and

anklebones. Look back to ver. 7.

His name. That 15, the effective power of Christ. “ Name,'⁷
saith Grotius, “ is here taken for virtue and power.”

And saith, &c. As if he had said, by his firm persuasion of the
divine power of Christ, which through Christ arises to that God
of whom you profess yourselves the adorers, this perfect soundness
is conferred upon him from above, before you 611. “then he
sayS, saith which is by him, by that word he means, that our faith
no otherwise ascends to God, but as it is founded in Christ.
Therefore then our faith looks to Christ, and relies upon him,”
saith Calvin. See 1 Pet. i. 21.

17. ΤΙινοῑιρῆ iynorance με did it. That is, more through a dull
and supine ignorance of the person, than any designed malice‚ you
and the senators of your great Sanhedriin wrested from Pilate that
unjust sentence, whereby he judged Christ, the Son of the living
God, to the torment of the cross. However, this ignorance does
not excuse your sin, but abates something of the heinousness of it,
and renders it the more easy to be pardoned by God. Hence
Christ doing that upon the cross which intercessors use to do,
omitting what was to be blamed in the fact of the Jews, applies
himself to that which in some measure tended to lessen the offence.
Father, says 116, foryive them, sor they know not what they d0, Luke
xxiii. 34.

18. God, &c. As if he had said, but God, who wiscly disposes
all things by counsel and reason, by means of your dull and sottish
ignorance brought that to pass which he knowingly and willingly
had decreed and foretold by his prophets, that Christ should suffer
to expiate the sins of mankind. Saith Tertullian‚¹ ‘⁶ The scrip-
tures declaring that Christ could suffer death, at the same time
affirm that he could be unknown. For unless he had been

unknown, he could not have suffered.’'
