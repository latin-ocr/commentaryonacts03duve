with an invincible power of the Spirit, lift up his eyes to heaven,
and straight saw a certain resplendency representing the Divine
Majesty, and J esus triumphing in that flesh in which he was
abased.

56. I see tlze heavens opened. The opening of the heavens is a
sign previous to visions, Ezek. i. 1. Some of the Hebrews will
have nothing else signified by the opening of the heavens, but
that any thing is done, or showed by a heavenly power. But the
pagans thought that the heaven was also opened by heavenly
portents. Livy, lib. xvii. saith, “ That the heavens were divided as
it were with a great gaping: and that a great light shined out where
it was open.'’ And on that of Virgil,¹ “1 see heavens part
asunder in the middle,” Minellius saith, “That it was divided and.
opened with a great chasma, or gaping.’ Servius ;2 “ Among other
prodigies, heaven was said to have parted asunder.”

And tlte Son of man, &c. A Hebraism, as if he had said, I see
that man Christ J esus, whom, as despised and the lowest of men,
you think destroyed by death, enjoy the government of all things
in heaven. Christ appears to Stephen not sitting, but standing on
the right hand of God, that he may thereby signify that he is ready
to afford him help in that conflict of his for his name. Yet in most
other places the phrase of sitting on the right hand, or right hands
of God is used, as more fitting to signify the glorious state of
Christ, to wit, that majesty and power of ruling all things, which
he obtained after his ascension into heaven, before which all must
stand and be judged. Augustine saith, that Christ is said to sit, as
a judge3 and to stand, as our advocate with the Father.

57. leen they eried out with a lond voice, &c. As if he had said,
Those of the multitude who were standing by, when they heard
this declaration of Christ's glory, breaking out with a horrible
noise, as if it had been intolerable blasphemy, they shut their ears,
either by putting their fingers therein, or the fiap of the ear, I
mean, that lowest, and soft part of the ear which the Greeks call
λοβὸς, from λαμβάνειν, “to take,”because the ancients pulled the ear
on that part, that they might give any a caution3 hence the poet,3

‘⁶ Then Phoebus, thus
Nipping my ear, advised.”

The Hebrews call this part in a sheep 5113), Amos iii. 12 3 in a man
mat), Exod. xxix. 20, and frequently in Leviticus; and Πζξδ, tail,
