by the preaching of bishop Wulfran, that he was to be baptized.
When he had entered into the font with one foot, drawing back
the other foot, he asked where the most part of his ancestors were?
whether in hell, or in paradise? And hearing that more were in
hell, drawing back his foot that was in the water: ‘It is better,' says
he, ‘that I follow the greater part then the fewer? And being so
deceived by the devil, promising that he would give him three
days hence matchless gifts, the self-same third day he perished with
a sudden and eternal death. Sigebertus. Henry of Erford does
relate the same out of the Acts and Monuments of Wulfran, chap.
xxvi. Burgomensis says that it was in the year 729.” Hither also
pertaineth the history of Constantine, who from hence got the sir-
name of Copronymus, because when he was baptized in his infancy,
he defiled the waters of the holy font with his excrements, in the
year of Christ 720. We have a like example in the emperor
WVenceslaus, the son of Charles the Fourth, who was born at
N orinburg the 28th of September, in the year 1361 : for
he also is reported to have defiled the water with his dung, when
he was baptized. Moreover it is reported that while the water
that was to be applied to the baptism of Wenceslaus was warming,
the pastor’s house by Saint Sebald was set on fire, and burned out.
Which things certainly could not happen, if both the Copronymus's,
the one in the west, and the other in the east, had been sprinkled,
and poured with a little water, being wrapped up in their swaddling
bands and clouts. About the end of the eleven hundredth year
after the birth of Christ, Odo, or Otho, bishop of Bamberg, who
first preached the gospel to the inhabitants of Pomerania, as
suffridus his assisting presbyter doth witness3¹ “ WVhen there were
three fonts built, he did so order, that he himself should baptize the
male children alone in one of the fonts, and the rest of the priests,
the women apart, and the men apart. What manner of fonts these
were, and after what fashion all were baptized, is declared there
after this manner: ‘ The good father caused the administration of
the sacrament to be done with so much diligence, also with so great
neatncss and honesty, that nothing indecent, nothing to be ashamed
of, nothing ever might be done there, which might not please any
of the gentiles. For hc commanded very big hogsheads to be
digged a little deep into the earth, so that the mouths of the
hogsheads did stand above ground unto the heighth of a man’s
