Is it laugful for you to scourqe? The Porcian and Semproniam
laws exempted a Roman citizen from stripes in a Roman judi-
catory, but not so in a J ewish, if any of the Jews were to be beat
according to their own laws. Hence Paul, who by birth was a
Roman citizen, yet as a J ew he received of the Jews five times

to be sold. Salvianus saith, that the title of Roman citizen was
purchased at a great rate.

And Paul said, But Ι was free born. That is, it is not a late
purchasc bath made me a Roman citizen, but my very birth. For
I am descended of progenitors that were free-born citizens. See
what we have said above, ver. 25.
