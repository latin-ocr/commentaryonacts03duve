And after one day. To wit, past at Rhegium.

Rhegium.

We came to Puteoli. In the Greek, the Latin name being a little
corrupted, it is Ποτιόλους. Varro, book iv., of the Latin tongue:
“From the word pzctez‘, ‘wells,' the city Puteoli has its name,
because about that place are many cold and hot waters, except it
be rather called so from putor, ‘stench,' because it has often a
noisome smell of brimstone or alum.” This city of Tuscany, that
is, Etruria, is called by three names, by Step'hen Byzantius, in
their proper places. For by him it is called Dicaea, Dicaearchia,
and Potioli. In Potioli he saith that it was built by the Samians,
and in Dicaea that it was a colony of the Ionians. St. Jerome, in
Euseb. Chron. lib. ii., Olymp‚ 64, art. 4: “The Samians built
Dicaearcliia, which is now called Puteoli.” Strabo saith of this
city, after his description of the lakes Lucrinus and Avernus:
‘⁶ N ext are the shores, or the coasts, about Dicaearchia, and the
city itself. It was once a dock of the Cumans, built on the brink
of the shore. But about the time of the war with Hannibal, the
Romans sent a colony thither, and changing its former name,
Dicaearchia, they called it Potioli, from putei, ⁶ wells.' Others from
putor, ‘stench,’ because of the· stench of its waters.⁷' The same
Strabo, a little after: “But the city was made a great mart town,
having artificial harbours for ships, by reason cf the natural con-
venience of the sand.'' Dicaearchia, as for the most part it is called
by the Greeks, is by Pliny (lib, iii. cap. 5) called the colony
Dicaearchia. It appears from the thirty—fourth book of Livy, that
Puteoli, Vulturnus, and Liternus were made colonies of Roman
citizens, when Publius Cornelio Scipio Africanus was consul for
the second time in the consulship of Titus Sempronius Longus,
and that three hundred men were sent into each of them. If
Puteoli did not afterwards lose its right of colony, Cornelius
Tacitus was mistaken when he said, book xiv. of his Annals:
“ Puteoli, an ancient city in Italy, obtained the right of a colony
and surname from Ner0.” Benjamin Tudelensis saith, in his
Itinerary, but without any author for it, that this city was
anciently called Surento, and that it was built by Hadarezer, who
