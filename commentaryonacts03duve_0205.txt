the Jews were corrupt interpreters of the law, in that they took
every thing in a carnal and earthly sense. Hence it is evinccd
that there was no wrong done to the temple or law, because Christ
is brought in as the end and verity of both. But seeing the state

With this agreeth that sharp upbraiding of J er. vii. 24, διο. Ezek.
xx. from ver. 5 to the end of the chapter. Nor is the promiscuous
multitude only accused of rebellion before God, but the priestS,
princes, and prophets are upbraided with the same crime, J er. ii. 83
