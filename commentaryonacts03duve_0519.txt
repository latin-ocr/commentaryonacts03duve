under Vespasian. But he died in the third year of Trajan, at
which time his history likewise concludes? ’' “ But there was no
eause,’' saith the same Scaliger, “why Eusebius should limit the
kingdom of Agrippa the younger with the destruction of Jerusalem.
For neither was he king of Jerusalem, nor had he any authority
over any part of the tetrarchy of Archelaus. For Caesar’s pro-
curator was always sent to the patrimony of Archelaus and {Jeru—
salem, who was called Epistropus of J udea.’' Thus J oseph
Scaliger, in his animadversions on Eusebius's Chronicle, with
whom, notwithstanding, the most renowed Seultetus cannot agree
in this that he says: ‘⁶ That there was always a procurator sent to
the patrimony of Archelaus and J erusalem.’' For when Agrippa
the elder reigned and governed J udea itself, he is of opinion that
the Jews paid tribute, not to the Romans, but to their own king3
nor that any procurator earne from Rome to Jerusalem. The
same Scaliger, on Eusebius, Num. 2,086: ‘⁶ Agrippa the younger,
the seventh and last of the kings of the raee of Herod, lived
thirty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, his kingdom
continuing safe, which he possessed twenty-six years, and increased
by the accession of some towns through the favour of Vespasian.
So far was the fortune of Jerusalem from causing any alteration in
his kingdom. What, therefore, did Eusebius mean? thcther
that after the destruction of Jerusalem, Agrippa continued in the
station of a private person, or that he was destroyed, together with
Jerusalem? But these things are both already confuted, as also
they are with this coin: AYTOKPATQP . OYECHACIANOC .

Agrippa remained king after Judea was taken. Elsewhere it is
ETOYS Κς. Eusebius has lieentiously enough indulged himself
in this fiction. But both the ancient and modern Jews are mis-
taken who say that their power of judgment was taken away from
them by the Romans forty years before the destruction of J erusa-
lem, that is, in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, which is
ridiculous For this befell them sixty-one years before the burning
of the temple3 about the time that Archelaus was banished to
Vienna. Whence is that, It is not lawful for us to ksill any man.
For Caesar’s governor, or procurator, devolving all the power on
himself, left very few things, and those of very small moment to
the consistory of the Jews, with these, moreover, which belonged
to their laws, rites, ceremonies‚ and songs.'’
