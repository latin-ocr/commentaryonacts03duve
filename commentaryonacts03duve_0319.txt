vnn. xxxvnn] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 299

“the resurrection of Christ, as the apostle interprete it, is called
τὰ ὅσια τοῦ Χριστοῦ πιστά. God also by the prophet, from whom
these things are taken, promiseth a resurrection, and the benefits
of the resurrection of Christ: he promised and foretold his death,
ch. liii. But what mercies are to be expected by a dead Mes-
siah, if he should be always dead? His benefits are weak and
infirm, if death should put an end to them. Therefore he pro-
miseth benefits and mercies which are firm, stable, and shall never
end, which shall flow from his resurrection.”

Sure. The Greek hath Πιστὰ, that is, according to Hesychius’s
interpretation, “firm,'’ and stable. In that very sense this Greek

his speech to God.

Thou shall not saffer. See what we have said above, ch. ii. 27.
‘⁶ Although,'’ saith Curcellaeus,1 “I deny not but these things were
in some respect fulfilled in David, as in the type, when God
delivered him from the hands of his enemies, and suffered them
not to take away his life, that he might afterwards rot in his
grave3 yet doth it far more eminently agree to Christ, who was
but for a short time left in the grave, in which he felt no cor-
ruption, nor did he afterwards return any more unto it3 when
David, who, though he felt no corruption at that time when his
enemies intended his death, yet afterward he, as all other men,
yielded to the necessity of nature.”

36. After he had served his own yeneration by the will of God.
That is, in governing his people, and advancing religion in some
measure.

Fell asleep, and was laid anto his fathers. That is, died, and
was buried, even as his fathers were.

And saw corruption. That is, and his corpse rotted in the grave.

37. leom, διο. As much as to say, But J esus Christ was in so
short a time restored from death to life, that his body laid in the
sepulchre was no ways vitiated with rottenness.
