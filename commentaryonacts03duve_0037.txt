vna. XL] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 17

white linen is called the righteousness of the saints, Rev„ xix. 8.
And though the holy garments were mixed with scarlet and
purple, yet there was also a mixture of white, and some of the
garments were white altogether. So that although Christ were
laden with our sins, which were signified by the scarlet colour‚
Isa. i. 18, and sprinkled for our sins with blood, which was
signified by the purple, yet was he most holy and just.

11. Ye men qf' Galz'lee. The disciples of Christ are called
Galileans as being natives of Galilee3 though all the Christians
were generally so called by the Jews and ethnics, as we have
observed upon these words of St. Matthew, into the parts of
Galilee, Matt. ii. 22. Julian the apostate in an epistle saith,
“ That the religion of the Galileans increased by their kindness to

Why stand με ιᾳαῖιῆζᾱ up into heaven? That is, In vain do ye
now expect the return of Christ with your eyes fixed upon
heaven· Saith St. Austin,² “The angels by those words, Why
stand ye yazz‘ngy up into heaven? what did they mean else but to
infer, That it was impossible for human eyes to penetrate into that
secret place whither Christ went, when he was carried up to
heaven in the sight of his disciples? ”

This same Jesas, &Q The particle, this same, is emphatical, and
denotes that the angels pointed with their fingers towards the
Lorsl J esus· “ Cease therefore to doubt,⁷’ saith St. Austin,‘-' ‘⁶ that
the man Christ J esus is now there, from whence he shall come;
but diligently get by heart, ancl faithfully retain the Christian
confession, that Christ rose from the dead, ascended into heaven,
sits at the right hand of the Father, and that he shall come from
thence, and from no other place, to judge the quick and the dead.
And so shall he come, according to the testimony of that angelic
voice, as he was seen to ascend into heaven3 that is, in the same
form and substance of the fiesh, to which he gave immortality,
but took away nothing of its nature. Yet he is not to be thought
to be everywhere diffused, according to that form. For we must
be careful that we do not so uphold the divinity of this Man, as to
take away the reality of his body. For it is not consequential,
that what is in God should be everywhere as God. For the most
true scripture speaks also of us, that we live, move, and have our
beinq in God, yet are we not everywhere as he is3 but- man is after
