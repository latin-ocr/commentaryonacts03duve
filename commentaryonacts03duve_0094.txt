still administered by several bishops and presbyters in private
houses. Which by their last canon, save one, was prohibited by
the fathers of the Council of Laodicea, ordaining that no oblations
should bc celebrated in private houses. This was in the year 364.
But the fathers of the Synod of Gangra, which was some twenty
years before that of Laodicea, condemned Eustathius, because hc
would not allow the private love-feasts of that sort, at which,
without doubt, they received also the sacrament. ‘If any one,’
say they, canon ix„ ‘despises these cordial entertainers of the
poor at their love—feasts, who out of respect invited the brethren
to their houses, and refuses out of contempt to be partakers of
such biddings to supper, let him be an anathema? For it is to
those private love-feasts that the canon of the Laodicean council
without question has reference, forbidding oblations in private
houses. For in those love-feasts, which were only entertainments
of private persons, inviting the faithful brethren to their houses,
was also celebrated the oblation, that is, the eucharist. For with
the brethren, they invited also the bishops or elders, by whom,
according to the custom of that time, the bread and wine was
blesscd into the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ.
Nevertheless the Laodicean canon did not take away the private
love-feasts, but only the custom of communicating the Lord's
supper therein. For in the 28th canon of the same synod, the
clergy and laity invited to the love-feasts are forbid to take any
parts of the victuals3 that is to say, according to the Greek way
of speaking, to carry any part home to their own houses. So
they were not forbid to go to the love-feasts, but to carry any
part away. By the same council the people were restrained from
celebrating their love-feasts in the temples, in which public love-
feasts most certain it is that the eucharist was wont to be taken.'’
These love-feasts seem to have their original from the sacred feasts
of the JeWS, Neh. viii. 10—12.

Did eat their meat with fflladness, ared sinyleness os heart. That is,

See Tertullian, Apologet. cap. 39. Some there are who, with
Chrysostom‚ believe that the love-feasts were wont to follow the
celebration of the Lord's supper, whereas, on the contrary, it is
apparent that the sacrament of the Lord’s death concluded the
supper, by the mmmm, which remained in Africa, upon the
anniversary night of the Lord’s supper : as appears by the Councils
