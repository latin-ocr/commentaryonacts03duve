Sat upon lais throne. Greek, “tribunal.” Βῆμα, in this place
is a certain sort of high seat placed in the theatre, whence
Josephus, in the lately cited place, saith, ‘⁶ He came into the
theatre.'' “Evcry piace,’' saith Grotius, “that is raised higher
than the rest, is by the Greeks called βῆμα, and by the Syrians
1:222, which word the Syriae translation here uses.”
