household-gods.⁷' Apuleius: ¹ ‘⁶ I beheld at the middle pillar,
which upheld the beams of the stable, almost in the very midst‚
the image of the goddess Hippona, dwelling in a shrine.’' Pliny,
speaking of the image of Venus carved by Praxiteles at Gnidos,
saith,² “ While its shrine is opened, that the image of the goddess
may be seen round about, which is believed to have been made by
her own help3 it is equally admired on every side.'' See also
Juvenal in his eighth Satire. Tertullian33 ‘⁶ If you furnish its
temple, its altar, or its shrine, it is no matter whether you build
or adorn it.'' Tibullus calls a shrine, esciyua cedes, “a little house.'’
“ The wooden god stood in a little house.'' By Arnobius these

cells, tu'qzcrz'ola, conclavia, celluloe.

seven times repaired3 but he agrees not with himself, for, book
xxxvi. ch. 36, he saith it was finished by all Asia in the space of two
hundred and twenty years3 there also he draws the structure of it.
This so sumptuous and magnificent a temple Herostratus burned,
that the memory of his wiekedness might spread his fame, as Solinus
saith, whose words out of his forty-third chapter I will here subjoin ε
“ The temple of Diana, the ornament of Ephesus, the building of
the Amazons, so magnificent that Xerxes, when he burned all the
temples of Asia, he spared this alone. But this Xerxes' clemency
kept not the sacred house long from evil; for Herostratus, that
the memory of his wickedness might spread his fame, did with
his own hands fire this noble fabric, out of a desire, as he him-
