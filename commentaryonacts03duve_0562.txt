of the first of the island, whose name was Publius. Him I take
to be whom the Romans made governor of the island 3 for it may
be gathered from this place, that the chief governors of this island
were commonly so called, as also from an ancient inscription which
Quintinus reports himself to have seen at Malta, written in
Greek on marble. A. KA. ΥΙΟΣ. ΚΥΡ. ΙΠΠΕΥΣ. ΡΩΜΑΙΩΝ.
ΠΡΩΤΩΣ. ΜΕΛΙΤΑΙΩΝ. ‘L. Ca. the son of Cyrus, a Roman
knight, the first of Malta? The Carthaginian governors had cer-
tainly before the same name, being styled by a phrase peculiar to
that place ΒἯΨΝἻΠ, ‘the first:⁹ So Dan. X. 13: Michael is reckoned

where it was impossible for so many strangers to be entertained
without great incommodities.

“Fffclzly. The account of their being carried to Puteoli in a ship
of Alexandria that wintered in the same island (Acts xxviii. 11), is
inconsistent with its being understood of the Dahnatian Malta,
since it is almost impossible to avoid the African Malta, When ye

“Sz‘xtlzly. This is further affirmed by Luke declaring that after
their setting forth from Malta, they arrived first at Syracuse, ancl
