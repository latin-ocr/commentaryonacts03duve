and J udea, as soon as Archelaus was banished. But he speaks not of
this taxing, which Luke in his gospel says, ch. ii. 1, 2, was made,
when Herod was yet reigning. But indeed it seems to me that
au error hath crept into Luke’s text in Quirinius²s name, and
that for Quirinius the name of Sentius Saturninus ought to be
restored. For this man, as Josephus testifieth, was governor
about the latter end of Herod's reign. Tertullian also writeth‚¹
that Judea was taxed by Sentius Saturninus. WVhence it appears,
that in Tertullian's time, some have read in Luke‘s gospel Satur-
ninus for Quirinius. Besides, it is strange that Josephus should
have pretermitted the first taxing, who yet ‚was so accurate in
prosecuting the history of his nation, that he reckons all the
governors of Syria3 for he mentioneth both Sentius Saturninus
and Quintilius Varus his successor. WVhen Eusebius understood
this, it was his judgment that it was the same taxing that Luke
and Josephus mentioned3 but that Josephus was mistaken, who
thought this taxing to have happened after Archelaus’s banish-
ment. Thercfore the same Eusebius‘2 placeth that tumult of
Judas the Galilean, which followed upon the taxing made by
Quirinius, about the time of Christ⁷s birth, and the end of Herod's
reign. Neither was Eusebius so stupid as not to see Luke and
Josephus to disagree among themselves in setting down the time
of this ‘taxing⁷ it being evident even to the blind. But in this
discord he for respect to the gospel, chose to disbelieve Josephus,
and to follow Luke, which opinion is indeed far more likely and
prohable than that of Scaliger, who thinketh there were two
taxings of Judea both made by Quirinius. But in this opinion of
Scaliger-³5, many things not very probable do occur. First, it
behoved Quirinius to have been twice sent to Syria for one and
the same purpose, to wit, to tax. F irst, about the time of Christ’s
birth, then about ten years after. But it is not probable that one
man should be twice sent to govern a province. It is certain that
Josephus, that accurate historian, when he mentions Quirinius's
coming to Syria and Judea, saith not that ever hc came to Syria
before, or that any taxing was before that time made either by
him or any other Roman judge. But if the taxing had been
made already, why is it done again by the same man? for if it had
been rightly made, and without fraud, it was no ways necessary it
should be done again3 but if not well, justly it behoved to send
