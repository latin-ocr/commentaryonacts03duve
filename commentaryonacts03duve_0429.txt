The word of the Lorcl Jesus. That is, the gospel of Christ
preached by Paul.

Boclz Jews cmcl Greeks. That is, as well they which being
descended of the Hebrew patriarchs, were reckoned among the
people of God, as the profane nations, who before this were aliens
from the people of God.

11. ΖῑΙὶνασίεε, &c. As much as to say, And that the truth of
the gospel preached by Paul might become the more famous, God
frequently confirmed it by miracles wrought by the same Paul.

12. From his body were brozzgslzt. To wit, Paul's.

superstition might arise by reason of the price or pompg for he
resolved entirely and fully to give all the glory to Christ.''

And the evil spirits went out (gf them. Out of their bodies, which

Of the vaqabond JewS. Who did run about to and fro, and did
creep into all public places, being to show some great thing to the
people, as jugglers or mountebanks used to do.
