384 THE AOTS OF THE Hom APOSTLES [CHAP. xvn.

26. All mztions of men. Το wit, as 1111611111111151 saith, “We are
all sprung of one man whom God made.’'

For to dwell on all tlteface of tlte earth. T hat is, that men being
multiplied and dispersed over all the regions of the earthly world,
should inhabit all the parts of the habitable earth. See Gen. xi. 8.
“ One man,'’ saith Lactantius in the foreoited chapter, “ was made
by God, and by this one the whole earth was filled with mankind.’'

And lzatlz determined. That is, having determined the times
wherein every people were to inhabit every region, which cannot
be prevented nor passed over.

27. Seek the Lord. As muoh as to say, God, by oreating men,
and distributing the earth to them to dwell in, proposed this end
to himself, that men should seek God, who is Lord and Creator of
heaven and earth, and of all things that are in them. To seek the
Lord is nothing else, but by worshipping of him earnestly to seek
his grace and favour, and to endeavour to be reconeiled to him, as

seek after God,” saith 0111661116115,ρ “ 111 1115 Dissertation of the
Neeessity of the Knowledge of Christ, “is the same as to give
him due worship and honour. Witness that of the holy writer,
that lte is a rewarder (gs them that detliyently seek ltz'm, Heb. xi. 6.
And to find him is to be partaker of his favour, as the prophet
showeth when he saith, Seek με tlte Lord, while he may be found ;
call upon lzz’m while he is near, Isa. lv. 6.

though he be so near us with his benefits, that 116 (1065 demonstrate

that he is easily found, if we shift not the pains of seeking after

him.

28. For in lzz'm we live, and move, and have our beinss. This
phrase, in him, 15 an Hebraism, signifying no more than by him.
