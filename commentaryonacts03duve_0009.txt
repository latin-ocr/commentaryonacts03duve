HISTORICAL INTRODU CTION. V

by the prompt interference of the by-standers. This early discipline in the
school of persecution was probably by no means unfavourable to his charac-
ter; but on the contrary tended to brace his mind to more vigorous research
for the assurance of his principles, and to prepare him for the brave endur-
ance of contumely and sufferings for righteousness' sake.

From Judaism he passed over to Roman Catholicism; that being, it
seems, the first form of the Christian saith to which he was introduced3
probably by some accidental associations. His literature and great abilities
soon rendered him distinguished among the members of that community
which he had newly chosen‚ and he figured as a preacher of no little cele-
brity among them in the Gallican church. In a short time he received
the diploma of Doctor in Divinity from the University of Anjou. With
characteristic zeal he took occasion, on publishing a commentar-y on the
Gospels of Mark and Luke, to plead for 1116 errors and superstitious of the
church of Rome, which he accomplished in so satisfactory a manner to
that body, that he was immediately invited to a controversy with the Hu-
guenots, who were at the time the great antagonists of popery in France.

The investigations of De Veil into the grounds of difference between
Catholics and Protestants‚ which were pursued with no little diligence and
research‚ for the purpose of refuting the latter, issued, however, in his own
conviction of the fallacy of those dogmas which he had hitherto maintained.
He was not a man to hesitate about the avowal of liis sentiments ; but he
deemed it prudent to fiee from the fury of those whom his change at once
converted into persecuting enemies. It may be thought that it was his
duty rather to have braved martyrdom than to have taken to flight, and we
must confess, while unacquainted with the circumstances which might have
justified, or or least modified, any condemnation of his apparent cowardice,
we should have honoured above no ordinary estimate the great act of
sacrificing his reputatiou and his life upon the altar of his God. He was
not, however, it appears, in this the incipient state of his new saith, strong
enough in his principles to die for them.

Escaping to Holland‚ he abjured popery, and soon hastened to England,
where he was introduced to new aud important associations. In what
manner he became acquainted with Dr. Stillingfleet, bishop of Worcester ;
Dr. Sharp, dean of Norwich; Dr Tillotson‚ dean of St. Paul's‚ and after-
wards archbishop of Canterbury; Dr. Patrick‚ dean of Peterborough, after-
wards bishop ofE1y; Dr, Lloyd, bishop of St. Asaph's; Dr. Compton, bishop
of London, a munificent patron os learned men; and many other clergymen
of eminence, we are not informed; only that these were his pati-ons and
