in Bel-eschith Rabba3 but it is profitable to know the rnadness of
this sect thoroughly. The later rabbins should have been
ashamed to grow wise3 therefore they follow the authority of
their fathers. But even this very self-same testimony out of
“ Bereschith Babba reproveth their error, where they acknowledge‚
out of the Prophecy of Zecharias‚ that the Messiah son of David
is to be poor. Therefore Aben Ezra acknowledges himself to be
ignorant whether Zecharias doth point at the Messiah there or
not: whereas Saadias Gaon will have Zecharias to prophesy there
of that Messias, to whom Daniel, ch. vii. 14, promiseth power,
riches, and an eternal kingdom. The other place of Moses, in
which Joseph is compared unto a firstling bullock, and which they
do attribute unto the Messiah son of J oseph, is applied unto the
Messiah son of David, in the Midrash Thehillim. The «Jews say
that Jacob did prophesy these words concerning the Messiah son
of David, Gen. xlix. 10: “Till he come who is to be sent, and
he shall be the expectation of the nations.'’ And these words,
Ps. lxxii. 17: And all the tribes qf' tlze earth shall be blessed in
lzim; all nations shall maynffy him. But in the book of the
Talmud, entitled Sanhedrim, the same testimonies are referred
unto that Messiah, of whom Isaiah spake, ch. liii. 4, Sur-ely he hath
borne our 975qu and carried om· sorrows. R. Solomon J archi, in
his Expositions upon the Gemara of Sanhedrim, and R. Moses
Alschech say, that the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah belongs unto
the Messiah son of David, in which are told the griefs, reproaches,
death of the Messiah, the which opinion, Ra. Isaac Abrabanel
retains in some places. This indeed doth teach that the Messiah
son of David, is signified in those worda which are, Isa. xi. 3, 4:
He shall not juclqe after the siqlzt (ff his eyes, neither reprove after the
heariny of his ears, but with rzyhteousness shall he judye the poor.
But thc same book of Sanhedrim teacheth that the Messiah, whom
Isaiah foretelleth there, shall be punished by God. The Messiah
that is sprung of Ruth, is the sels-same that was the nephew
of David; notwithstanding we read in Ruth Rabbathi, that a
kingdom and calamities are portended unto this Messiah in these
words, which are in Ruth ii. 14 ι Come hither, and eat (gf the bread,
and (Hp thy mor-sel into the vineyar. Therefore some rabbins of no
small note do agree that there is one only Messiah to come twice.’'
