21. Thac he is the Son of God. He saith presently, ver. 22,
Thac this is very Christ. It seems this surname was commonly
given to the Messiah. For Nathaniel saith, John i. 49, Rabhi, thou
art tlte Son of God, thou art tlze kz'nq of Israel, to wit, out of the
second Psalm, which the ancient Hebrews, in the abstruse sense,
interpreted of the Messiah. Therefore, where Peter in Matthew,
xvi. 16, calls him Christ the Son qf the liviny God, Mark and
Luke satisfied themselves with the name Christ. And no wonder,
seeing‚ as Origen saith excellently, ‘⁶ What was divine in that man
J esus whom we understand, the very same was the ,only begotten
Son of God.”

Is not this, &o As much as to say, Is Saul also among the
prophets? 1 Sam. x. 11.

Thac destroyed all them tlzczt called upon tlcz's name z‘n Jerusalem.
That is, raged with great cruelty against all Christ's disciples at
Jerusalem. “ The Greek word,’' saith Grotius, “ which is rendered,
‘destroyed,' signifieth to ⁶ veX.⁷ Paul useth the same word in this
history,” Gal. i. 13, 23.

And came lzz'ther. To wit, to Damascus

‘⁶ in speech.''

And confozmdesl tlze Jews. As much as to say, And being thus
strengthened by the Holy Ghost, he confuted, reproved and con-
vinced the Jews.

“teaching them,'' as tho Arabian turns it: “teaching them for
certain,” as the Ethiopic renders it. It answers to the Hebrew
word, mm, Which is rendered “to instruct, to cause to unde1·stand,’⁷
Isa. xl. 143 Dan. ix. 22 ; and the word, »Ἧι-τ, that is rendered, “to
make known,” Exod. xviii. 163 Deut. iv. 93 Isa. lx. 133 also Πῖιῆπ,
“to teach,” Exod. iv. 12, 15; Lev. x. 113 Psa. xxxii. 10. Συμβι-
βάζειν, is properly to join things by art, that by an indissoluble
tie they may stick together. But he who teachcth any other, allures
him to himself, and by persuading and convincing him, does, as it
were, knit and glue him to himself. Hence, in Hesychius, συμ-
βῖβασις is interpreted “ persuasion, doctrine, faitl1;” συμβιβάτο,
“let him teach 3 ⁷³ συμβιβασθέυτες, “ those that have been taught.’'
