Greeks for a cloak. Hesychius, the most learned of interpretcrs,

to the ³32, of the Hebrew shepherds, which was either a cloak, or
a satchel, in which they used to put their meat and cups, out of
which they drank, and their other necessaries. Such a one is that
of Zech. Xi. l5, σκεῦος ποιμένος ἀπείρου, the vessel Of a foolish
shepherd. Although there the Greeks render vessels in the plural
number.’'

‘⁵ F our—footed beasts, and wild beasts, and creeping things.” The
word Πῆῖῦῗῐζῑ, four-footed beasts, in the Vulgate Latin edition is
taken in as large a sense here as amongst the naturalists. But in
the Greek text it only con‘lprchends domestic creatures, and which
are wont to be kept for the common use of men, as caniels, horses,
asses, dogs, oxen, sheep, hogs, and others of that kind: and there—
fore is added, and wilc! beasts. The Hebrew noun ΠᾩΠῖς is taken
four ways: first, for any brute creature, as when it is only opposed
to man, as Ps. lxxiii. 22. thencc it is, that the serpent is also
rcckoned amongst the ΠῆὈΠΣᾎ, Gen. iii. 14. Secondly, for any
four-footed beast, somewhat big, which brings forth young ones
alive, when it is opposed to birds, reptiles, and whatsoever liveth
under the water. But wheresoever ΠᾨΠΞ] and Πῖῐ] are opposed, as
Gen. i. 25, then ΠᾩΠζῑ signifies beasts of burden, flocks, or any
domestic cattle, and Πῖζτ wild cattle, whose other name 1³1 Ps. 1. 11,

Hebrew ῑἾ and Arabio Imma, signifies “to niovc,'’ or, “move
one’s self.'⁹ For the talne and gentle animals have their pastures
ascertained by their owners, and are fed at home : on the contrary,
the wild cattle wandel· about here and there for their sood, and
(as the philosopher says) like shepherds‚ are forced from place to
place for their food. But it appears fron] 1 Sam. xvii. 443 Isa.
xviii. 63 Jer. xxvii. 33, that wild beasts are also often compre-
hended under ΠἽὉΠᾎ. Moreover in Deut. xiv. 4, 5, stags, roeS,
