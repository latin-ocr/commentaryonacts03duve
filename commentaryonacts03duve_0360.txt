same father on Matt. xv. says: “That he is fed by faith, who
believes that what he eats was neither offered in the sacrifices of
idols, nor strangled, nor blood.” And at another place:l “ Thou
seest that this law of refraining from blood, which was given in
common to the children of Israel and to the strangers, must also
be observed by us, whom the scripture useth to call proselytes and
strange1·s.’⁷ Tertullian in his Apologetic, ch. ix„ coming to refute
the scandals of the Gentiles who charged the Christians with
killing of infants aud eating them, does it thus : ‘⁶ Let your error
blush to object this to the Christians, who allow not so much as of
the blood of animals at our tables3 nay further, who abstain from
things strangled and that die of themselves, lest we should in any
kind be defiled with blood at least, Which is hidden within the
gutS. Lastly, Even you yourselves amongst the trials of Christians
are wont to bring to them some puddings well filled with blood ;
well knowing that to them that is unlawful by which you would
have them exorbitate3 and how comes it to pass that you should
believe those whom you know to abhor the blood of a beast, are

that we admit not the blood of beasts among our viands.” In
the book called the Apostle's canons, wherein are contained
the most ancient customs of the church, the sixty-third canon
runs thus: ‘⁶ If any bishop, priest, or deacon, or any of the
Holy order shall eat flesh in the blood thereof, or anything that
died of itself, or taken by wild beasts, let him be degraded, for
these things the law forbids3 but if he be a layman let him be
excluded from connnunion.’⁷ The Council of GangreS, ΑΩ. 325,
Can. 2 : “ If any shall condemn a man that with piety and'faith
shall have caten of any sort of flesh, which is not defiled with
blood, or offered to idols, or strangled, as such a one who
for such promiscuous eating is excluded from hopes of salvation,
let him be anathema.'’ Beholdl here the fathers being to assert
the use of flesh against certain heretics‚ do yet except blood and
strangled, and idol-offered. Cyril of Jerusalem, Catech. 4, ‘⁶ The
apostles and elders write a common general epistle to all the
Gentiles, that in the first place they forbear meats consecrated to
idols, and next from blood and what is strangled: for many rude
