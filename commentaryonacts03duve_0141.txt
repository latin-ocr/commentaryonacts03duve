vnn. xxxin] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 121

¹ spake thus as if he approved the doctrine of the gospel, or would

undertake its defence, but seeing all the rest stirred up with fury,
being a gentle and moderate man, he by his discourse moderates
their excess. “In the meantime,” saith Capellus, “his disciple
Paul most cruelly raged against the church of Christ, and wasted
it, and Maimonides¹ attributes a fact to Gamaliel far different (as
it seems) from this advice, for he saith, that when he saw heretics
so abound in his days (meaning Christians, there being none other
at that time among the Jews that might be supposed to have been
so called), he composed a form of prayer, in which God was
requested to extirpate the heretics, which form he put with the
other forms of prayer in the Jewish liturgy then used, that it
might be ready in every one's mouth„ If this fact 116 true, it
seems to argue such an enraged spirit against the Christians, and
hatred at the Christian religion, to have been in 11116 man, as suits
not well with this advice of his, which Luke gives here an account
of 3 except that one would think to reconcile Maimonides and
Luke by saying 11116 was Gamaliel’s mind and judgment, that
although the apostles and their followers were heretics, and even
dangerous, yet they were not to be suppressed by human violence,
nor the counsels of human policy, 11111 1116 whole of it should be
committed to the wise providenoe of God, that their rooting out
must be looked for from God, and not hastened by human con-
trivanees, and therefore that for this purpose he composed that
prayer, and added it to 1116 rest in 1116 daily liturgy, whereby God
was besought 10 root out these men if they were ungodly and
heretics3 that if they were not from God, he himself would in a
way and manner most agreeable to 1116 own providence and wisdom
disappoint and overturn their designs. As to Paul, Gamaliel’s
disciple, that bitter persecutor of the church of Christ, two things
may be answered, to wit, that Gamaliel himself was indeed at first
of the same disposition with Paul against the apostles and their
followers, which was cruel and fieree, but that then he had
changed his thoughts, God having inclined his heart to milder
courses, which often comes to pass, or that afterwards Paul
dissented from his master, as being of a hotter temper, and there-
fore of a more angry and hostile spirit against those who he
thought would overturn the Jewish religion received from their
fathers, for which he was a great zealot.”
