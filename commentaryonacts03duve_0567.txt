vmz. 111.] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 547

Assailed leis hand. Greek, καθῆψε τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ. That is,
as the English translation readers it, fastened on lais leand, to wit,
that she might sting with her raging tooth. The AEthiopic reads
it, “ hung on his hand.” The Syriae, and both Arabics, “ did. bite
his hand3’' of which opinion were some of the fathers. To this
purpose, Tertullian, speaking of Paul, in his book intituled
Scorpiacus, or Little Scorpion: “He set at nought the viper's
sting.⁷’ And Ambrose, in his Hexae‘meron, lib. vi. cap. 6: “A
viper did bite Paul.” Prudentius also, in the fore-cited place z—

The smoke of th’ fire reviv’d the viper’s sense,
Whence stretching forth her neck, she does commence
A demonstration of her rage 3 the hand

Of Paul she stings, and sticks close to the wouml,

That all might hear the poison‘s hissing sound ;
So that each one at this amaz’d did stand.

And Arator, in his second book of the Apostolical History z·—

On whom the snake
Her (levilish darts at th' fires approach did shake,
A wound by wonted rage aud poison cold,
His haud sustains, as all behold.

OEcumenius, also: “A viper having thrust her teeth into the
apostle’s hand.’' But the most famous Bochart, is (with far
greater probability) of opinion that the viper was restrained from
fastening her noisome teeth into the apostle's hand, by the same
God that by his angel shut up the mouths of lions, insomuch that
they could not hurt with their teeth the prophet, Dan. vi. 22.
“ Which,” says he, Hierozoici‚ p. 2, lib. iii. cap. 3, “ the words of
Luke seems plainly to declare, ’έπαθευ οὐδὲν κακὸν, ⁶ he sustained
no hurt.’ For he could not be said to sustain no hurt that was
stung by a viper. Neither, for aught I know, does καθάπτων,
import to bite or sting, nor to assail or hang, but ‘to fasten? as
the simple word ἄπτειυ.” Having proved, by divers authorities,
which you may see cited at large in the Latin edition of this
Literal Explication on the Acts of the Holy Apostles, he con—
cludes thus: “Wherefore‚ Stephen adds ἑαυτὴν to the words of
Luke, καθῆψε τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, rendering it thus, ‘she tied her-
self to his hand, or fastened on it.’ ’⁹ So Basilius thought good to
say, while he gives account of the same story in his N inth Homily
on the Hexaemeron, or Six Days, φρυγανιζομέυῳ τῷ Παυλῷ ἐνάψας
ὁ ἐ’χις, understand ἑαυτὸν, ‘ the viper having fastened on Paul
while he was a gathering of sticks.' N evertheless, by others it is
rendered ‘hang,’ because ἀφάπτειν, and ἒξανάπτειυ, signify ‘to
