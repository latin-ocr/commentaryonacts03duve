VER. xvir] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 529

They used helps. To wit, of the mariners, or, as some will, of
ropes, chains, and hooks.

Underqirdiny tlze slcip. To wit, putting ropes on both sides,
underneath the boat, and so binding the sides of the ship on both
sides, that it might not be beat to pieces by the force of the winds
and waves.

And feariny lest they should fall on tlte qaicksands. That is, lest
the ship together with them, should be driven upon shallows and
the sirts, and should stick fast thereon, and be overwhelmed with
a heap of saud. Siris, or qfflcksands, arc called all shallow
places, which as it were draw the ships that. are driven on them,
and keep them fast, and at last swallow them up. Lucan has
described the nature of these sirts, lib. ix. 304, which is thus
Englished by Sir Arthur Gorges 2-

When nature did at first (lispose,

These sirts and shap'd their figure out,
She left it to the world in doubt,
NVhether it should be land or seas ;

For utterly it doth not please,

To sink itself beneath the main z

Nor yet the land cannot restrain

The waves, but they will have a share,
And such a dangerous place prepare, ἔ
That there to travel none shall dare.

For here the sea doth channels strain,
And there the lands do rise again.

Here is a long-stretch'd tract of shore,
And there the swallowing whirlpools roar,
So nature wretchedly designed,

This portion of her proper kind.

Unto no use, or else of old,

Those sirts more waves in them did hold, }
And with the sens were over-roll’d.

But that attractive Titan’s beams,
(Feeding upon the ocean's streams,

That to the torrid zone were nigh)

Some of the weltering waves did dry.
And yet the ocean in despite,

Resisteth Phoebus’ parching might.

But yet his beams (as they draw near) ζ
And wearing time those seas will clear,
And make the sirts firm land appear. s
For scarcely now a little boat,

Can on the superfices float,

Of thos‹.¹ drown'd sauds where water stays,
And more aud more that sea deeays.

They are the most famous of the sirm, which Sallust describes
