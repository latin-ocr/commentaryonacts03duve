number. Aristotle saith,¹ that Pamphila the daughter of Latous,
of the same island, was the inventrix of these garments. The
reason why they were invented waS, that women might be as little
covered with their garments, as if they were naked. To which
Tibullus seems to allude. And Pliny, in the aforesaid book, saith:²
“ Nor were men ashamed to make use of these garments by reason
of their lightness in summer. So far are they from wearing armour,
that their very clothes are a burden to them.’' At this (lay this
island is called LangO.

And tlte followiny day unta Rhodes. A most famous island,
which, according to Ptolemy, lib. v. 2, is situated betwixt Tcaria
and Lycia. It was renowned for these cities, Lindus, Camirus,
and Rhodes, as Pliny relates, lib. v. 31, in which the day is never
so cloudy, but the sun shines bright some hour or other of it3
witness the same Pliny, lib. ii. 62, whence the poets called it
bright.³ Rhodes was of old very rich in shipping‚ as appears by
Strab0.4 Its inhabitants built Parthenope, i. e. N aples, among the
Opici, and Rhoda in Spain. They first taught the Spanish marin-
ers to make ropes and maps, very useful for man3 they also first
imported into Spain money, beaten out of brass, as Strabo in the
forecited book, and Mariana testify.5 Rhodes was beautified with
one hundred colossi, one of which was reckoned among the seven
wonders of the world. Now these colossi were piles of statues
exaetly devised, equal to towers3 for which cause, as many are of
opinion, the Rhodians were called Colossians, to whom the Epistle
of St. Paul was written, entitled to the Colossians. Rhodes has
been subject to several vicissitudes3 after this it was subject to the
Romans3 the Saracens took it in the year of our Lord 615. The
Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem recovered it in the
year 1308, and kept it till the year 1602 ς in which year Solyman
the Second defeated them, and retook it3 in lieu whereof Charles,
fifth Emperor, gave the Knights of St. John the island of Malta3
whence they are commonly called the Knights of Malta.

And from thence mzto Patara. A city of Lycia, according to
Hecataeus in his Asia, which still retains its name, as Niger
affirms,6 describing the situation of Lycia, and, as he says, not far
from the sea, where there is a sea-port town eleven miles distant
from it, named Phoenix, very dangerous by reason of the rocks
