words, but with her works. Peter knew that what was thus asked,
might be obtained3 and that Christ’s assistance would not be want-

of those widows When therefore he prayed upon his knees, and
this fit advocate for the poor and widows had presented to God the
prayers addressed to him, having turned about to the body that lay
already washed upon a table, Tabitlza, saith he, rz'se in tlte name of
,Iesus Christ. Neither did He, who said in his gospel that he would
give whatever was asked in his name, fail Peter, but brought pre-

and to the wonder and astonishment of all, the revived body is

again. Therefore Ezekiel, holding out the deliverance of the peo-
ple under the type of the resurrection, ch. xxxvii. 4, Dry bones
saith he, hear tlze 200cm (ff the [οι-(Ζ. And Christ, John v. 25,
Tlee dead shall lzear the voice qs the Son of God, ancl they tlmt
