124 THE AC'sS OF THE HOLY AI’OSTLES [CHAP. V.

or some other, I know not what, absurd plaster must be applied,
rather than Josephus must be aoeused of a mistake, who yet is
found often to trip and reel both in history and ehronology. I
would therefore think Josephus’s Theudas to be Gamaliel's, but
that Josephus, mistaking the time, stained a true history with
false ohronology.”

Sayz‘ny he was somebody. That is, boasting himself to be some
great and eminent deliverer of the Jews from the servitude, with
which the Romans oppressed them. This history J osephus relates
thus,l (and after him Eusebiusfl) While Cuspius Fadus governed
Judea, a certain juggler named Theudas, having gathered together
a great multitude of men, persuaded them to carry away their
goodS, and follow him as their captain to the river Jordan, and
being, as he himself said, a prophet, made them believe by his
power he would divide the water, and so they might have easy
passage. By such speeehes he deceived many. But shortly after
Fadus suppressed their madness, having sent some troops of horse
against them, who having suddenly surprised them, killed some,
and took others prisoners. Theudas himself was also taken by
them, whose head they eut off and carried to Jerusalem.

this man,'' as we showed in the verse immediately preceding out of
Valesius’s notes upon Eusebius.

Rose up Judas of Galilee. Of him Josephus saith thus,³ (and
out of him Eusebius 4): Judas the Gaulanite, born in the town of
Gamala, having joined one Saddoek a pharisee in his society,
stirred up the people to revolt3 both of them saying that the tax
was nothing but a mark of manifest bondage3 and eneouraged the
whole nation to defend their liberties. The same in the second
book of the Jewish Wars, o. 7. ‘⁶ At that time a certain Galilean,
named J udas, stirred up the inhabitants to revolt, openly up-
braiding them, that they should thus endure to pay tribute to the
Romans, and own, besides God, some mortal men to be lords over
them.’' The same Josephus calls ⁵ this J udas the Gaulanite, J udas
the Galilean. Perhaps he was commonly believed thus, because
that in Galilee he chiefly stirred up his tumults, though Gaulan
and Gamala belonged not to Galilee, but to Perea, or the region
beyond Jordan.
