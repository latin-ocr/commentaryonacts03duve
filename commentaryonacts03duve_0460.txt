words, yet that it was his doctrine is gathered from his sayings,
which are mentioned by the evangeliste.

It is more blessecl to yive than to receive. First because, to give is
a sign of abundance, but to receive a sign of want, as Augustine
writes. Next because, to give is more honest and a mark of a
virtue, to wit, bounty or liberality, but to receive is no sign of
virtue, but either of necessity or of covetousness. Which Aristotle
also observed when he wrote,1 that it was more proper for virtue to
bestow a benefit than to have one bestowed upon it. Lastly,
chiefly because he that liberally gives help to the indigent, shall,
for that 116 gave, have a great reward from God3 but he who
receives a benefit shall for the receiving of it have no reward.
Luke xii. 333 xvi. 93 xviii. 223 1 Tim. vi. 1-9. But yet it is
neither unhonest nor unconvenient, if one shall receive a reward as
due to him, for that which by his honest labour he deserved, pro-
vided that this receiving may be without offence. See Matt. x. 10,
and our literal explanation there 3 Luke x. 73 1 Cor. ix. 143 l Tim.
v. 17, 18.

to God and reverence towards him, that one who prayeth should
knecl. Solonion prayed fervently with bended knees, 1 Kings viii.
523 2 Chron. vi. 13. Also Daniel, Dan. vi. 10. And Jesus Christ,
Luke xxii. 41 3 and Stephen, above, ch. vii. 603 and Peter, above,
611. ix. 403 and Paul here, and below, ch. xxi. 53 and Eph. iii. 14.
But that to pray standing was the most commonly received custom
among the Jews is clear by that in Nchemiah, 611. ix. 5, the
pcople are commanded to stand at prayer 3 and Gen. xviii. 22,
where it is in the Hebrew, Abraham “stood before God,’' the
Chaldean renders it ‘⁶ p1·ayed.” N either is the verb standing, other-
wise used in Jer. xv. l ς xviii. 203 and Job xxx. 20. So Mark xi.
25, W lzen με stand prayings. And Luke xviii. 11, The pharisee stood
and prayed. See our literal explanation, Matt. vi. 5.

W‘zfle them all. To wit, with the elders or bishops of the church
of EpheSUS, whom he sent for from Ephesus to Miletus, to instruct
them with wholesome admonitions, above, ver. 173 doubtless,
among other things, Paul, in this prayer to God, prayed for divine
assistance, that he would help the elders of the church of Ephesus
to perform these things of which he admonished them.

37. Ami they all wept sore. To show their sorrow for his future
absence.
