the prayers of his servants, and grant what they ask, if he had no
power. Hence it appears that that, ff 3‘3 ask anythz'ny in my
name, is to be understood of prayers immediately directed to him 3
as if he had said, If ye ask anything of rne, relying on my power
and promise. Otherwise there is no question but we may, yea, it
is our bounden duty to direct our prayers to God the Father‚ in
the name of J esus Christ, as we are taught, John xvi. 23. But
of such prayers it is not spoken in this place. Therefore also
Stephen made no scruple to call upon Him, even while he was a
dying, saying, Lord JesuS, receive my spirit. VVhere they ridicu-
lously shift, who will have the word J esu to be of the genitive
case3 as if Stephen had not directed his prayers to J esus himself,
but to Grod the Father‚ who is the Lord of J esus. For, besides
that J esus Christ in the writings of the N ew Testament is always
denoted by the name of Lord, to distinguish him from God the
Father, even the use of the Greek tongue doth not permit that in
that phrase, Κύριε Ἰησοῦ, the latter word Ἰησοῦ should be of the
genitive case3 for then it must have had an article prefixed to it,
and been expressed τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, to distinguish the person of J esus
from God the Father3 otherwise there is no person skilful in that
language, who can take that phrase otherwise than in the vocative
case, as Rev. xxii. 20.''

saith did not seek Christ upon earth, but viewed him standing on
the right hand of God: there he found him where he sought him
with devotion of mind. But Stephen not only sees Christ in
heaven, but toucheth him also by his martyrdom. For he toucheth
the Lord while he prayeth for his enemies, and as it were holding
him with his faith, he saith, Lord, lay not this sin to their elzarye.
Understand therefore how great glory there is in true devotion.
Mary Magdalene, John xx. 17, though standing near our Lord,
does not touch him: Stephen, while upon earth, toucheth Christ
in heaven; she seeth not a present Christ among the angels:
Stephen among the Jews beholdeth his Lord while absent.'’

Lay not. Greek, στήσῃς. “ Verbally rendered,” saith Grotius,
“it is ‘weigh not.' ’⁹ So Ezra viii. 25—323 Job xxviii. 15; Jer-
