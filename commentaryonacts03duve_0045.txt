VER. XVIII] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 25

Daniel Brenius, upon this place of St. Peter, “he understands the

· assemblies of the faithful congregated out of the Jews and Gen-

tiles, to whom, through Christ, their lot is fallen among the people
of God, who being his peculiar, and not the property of the bishops,
they are therefore to act not according to their will and pleasure,
but according as they are prescribed. Allusion being made to the
allotnients of the tribes, who had their divisions in the land of
Canaan by lots3 but chiefly for this reason, that Israel is said to be
the portion and inheritance of God.’⁷

Of tlzz‘s mim‘stry. In the Greek, “ of this deaeonry.” Deaconry
signifies the exereise of any office or function3 but below, ver. 25,
where the word “apostleship” is added, there it is restrained only to

man out of his covetousness of shameful gain delivered the Author
of salvation into the hands of the Jews, and, suddenly snatehed
away by a severe death, got nothing by such a detestable and inhu-
man crime, but a small pittanee of earth for the burial of his body
in that field, which the priests jointly bought with the restored
hire which they had given to J udas. For Luke, as Heinsius notes,
did not say, ‘⁶ he possessed the little field,” in reference to the whole
field, but “ a little field? that is, he possessed a little part of the
field. For when he comes to speak of the whole field, or the field
itself, he does not only say, ‘⁶ the little field,'’ but “ that little field.’'
‘⁶ What then,'’ says Heinsius, “means that word, a little field Ρ Α
part of the earth, or place sufficient to contain the body of the

And being] leangsed. In the Greek, ‘⁶ and being headlong :’' “ For
the Greek word,'’ saith Leigh, in his Sacred Critics, “does not
properly signify hanged, but prone, headlong, and with head down-
ward, and signifies the posture of a person suffocated with a halter,
' with the face hanging toward the earth, as Erasmus observes.'’
Others render the Greek, ‘⁵ and being cast down headlong‚’' or as
