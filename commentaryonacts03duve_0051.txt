to declare which of these two, conspicuous for their uncorrupted
conversation and integrity of life, thou art pleased to substitute
into the place of J udas, since, which is most worthy to be preferred
cannot be discerned by human judgment.

From which Judas by transqressz'on fell. The Greek has it, “from
which J udas declined, or turned aside.'⁷ “ But,'⁷ saith Beza, “the
genuine interpretation of these words is to be collected from the
following coherences. For the vocation of every man is as it were
the way and road where every one is to journey, if he intend to
attain to the end of his stage. From this way, therefore, that is,
from the apostleship, Judas is said to have deviated, or turned
aside, or rather, leaving it altogether, to have taken a quite contrary
path. Epiphanius reads the article from wlcz'clz in the masculine

taken for ‘⁶ his,” the same worthy author proves out of Ecumenius 3
as Budaeus affirms the pronoun suum to be frequently used instead
of ‹37¹ch by Cicero, in imitation of the Greeks, So that, ‘⁶ to go to
his place’' is the same thing as in the English law phrase, to enter

reason than that of those who understand the words as spoken of
Judas3 as if Luke would say, that J udas went into his place,
that is, into hell. Nor can I believe that ever any such thing
entered into the thoughts of the evangelist. But I admire with
Chrysostom the prudence of the evangelist, who does not reproach
nor insult over any person. Which argues that Chrysostom did
not believe that St. Luke had adjudged J udas to hell. For what
