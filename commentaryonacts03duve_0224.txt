clemency and mercy useth one of the heavenly messengers, who
now are subject unto him since he is gone into heaven, 1 Pet. iii.
22, to communicate that knowledge that bringeth salvation unto
men.

Spake anto Philip. Viz„ the deacon, and now an evangelist,
who 111 Samalia first pr eached the doctrine of Christ, and declared
it to be true by miracles.

Arz'qse &c. The angel neither speaking any thing rashly, nor
concealing any thing craftily, expresseth unto Philip whither he

is slimy3 the city itself is great, and situated on a high hill, and
compassed about with a strong· wall, it is the utmost inhabited to
one that goeth out of Phoenicia unto Egypt, at the entrance of the
wilderness.'' At length Alexander king of the Jews, who also
was called J anneus, Aristobolus’s brother, did demolish it: witness
Josephus.‘-' Samson, or Simson, of old a judge of the Hebrews,
did make this city famous by his noble acts, and death, Judges xvi.;

learn by Justus the Hebrew, and Dominicus Marius Niger in 1115
