Luke distinguishes them from those whom he afterwards calls
Ἑλληνισταὶ. Moreover, having said that the word was preached
to none but to the Jews, and noted those, who being banished
their country, lived in Cyprus and Phenicia: as it were eorrecting
this exception, he says that the Grecians were taught by some of
these. Certainly that antithesis makes us expound it as meant of
the Gentiles„ For Luke shows, that some few did more freely
disperse the gospel, because they were not ignorant of the calling
of the Gentiles, since that Christ had commanded, Mark xvi. 15,
that from the time of his resurrection, the gospel should be pro-
miscuously preached to the whole world.” And the most learned
Grotius says, that. we should not in this place read Ἑλληνιστάς, as
it is in the vulgar Greek copies, but ’Έλληνας, as it is in the
Alexandrine copy in England, and as the SyrIae, Latin, and

men ‘ff Cyprus and Cyrene, preaehing the gospel to the Greeks or
Gentiles, and helped them, so that many of the Grecians were
stirred up, and persuaded to believe in Christ.

conversion of these Grecians or Gentiles came to the ears of the
ehurch at Jerusalem, which had learnt from Peter that God by
evident signs had testified that, together with the Jews, the Gen-
tiles should by their guidance be called to partake of Christ's
grace, the members of that church sent Barnabas, a Cyprian, that
he might make a further improvement of the rudiments of faith
