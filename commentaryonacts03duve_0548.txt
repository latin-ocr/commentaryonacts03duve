is an island near Crete, wherein are brought forth very great wild
asses.” But that this island was by Mela, lib. ii. cap. 73 and Pliny,
lib. iv. cap. 12, called Gaudon, by Ptolemy Claudon, after J oachim
Vadian, the now cited Bochart observes. There was also another
island, which by Strabo, lib. vi. is called Gaudos, but by Stephan
and others Gaulos, in the Sicilian Sea towards Africa, as Mela de-
clareth, lib. ii. cap. 7.‚ one of the three islands, in old times inhabited
by the Carthaginians, which, according to Scylax, were, Melite,
Gaulus, and Lampas. Solinus, cap. xxxii„ reporteth almost the
same of this Gaudo, or rather, Gaulus of the Carthaginians, as
Pliny says of the island Galata, near to the said Gaulus, “that
neither is any serpent brought forth there, nor if it be transported
thither does it live, wherefore the dust of this island being cast
upon any other ground, driveth away serpents, and being thrown
upon scorpions, it immediately kills them.'’

fying, “to make hollow,'' because they first were used to be made
of a whole great tree, by making it hollow.
