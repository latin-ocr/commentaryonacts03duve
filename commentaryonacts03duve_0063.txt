is a most famous country of Africa, not of Asia, under the do·
minion of the Turks ever since the year 1517. It extends in
length from the Mediterranean Sea to Syene. The river Nile
runs through the middle of it, whose inundations make it fertile.
Το its east lie the deserts of Arabia3 to the west, Lybia3 to the
south, Ethiopia3 and to the north, the Mediterranean Sea.'’

And tlte parts of Lybz'a round about Cyrene. The Upper Lybia
was called Pentapolitan, from the number of her cities, of which
the names were Berenice, Arsinoe, Ptolemais, Apollonia, and the
most famous of all, Cyrene, from which all the upper Lybia is
sometimes called Cyrenaic. ‘⁶ The bounds of this Cyrenaic Lybia,”
saith Spanheim, ‘⁶ were the greater Syrtis to the west; the country
of the Psylli and the desert Lybia to the south, and Marmaric
Lybia to the east.’' See our annotations upon Amos ix. 73 Matt.

selves to them, as Tibullus, Ovid, and Philo witness.''

seated between the Lybie and Egaean sea, to the south of the
Peloponnesus, and to the east of the island Carpathus, was one of
the first that were illuminated with the light of the gospel by the
preaching of St. Peter, Acts ii„ and the great pains of Paul and
Titus? But the most learned Lightfoot believes,¹ that by Cretes
are understood here the inhabitants of that region of Palestine
which we have already observed to be called Creth by the Syrians,
in our notes upon Wisdom ii. 5, because the Cretes are here joined
with the Arabians, who are contiguous to the land of Palestine.

Arabiam. Arabia is a country of Asia, neighbouring upon
Africa, bounded to the north by Syria and the river Euphrates, to
the east by the Persian Guif3 to the west, by the Arabian Gulf3
and to the south, by the Arabian Sea, or part of the Indian Ocean.
It is threefold3 the desert Arabia, where the Israelites abode
forty years 3 the Happy, or spice-bearing3 and the Stony, famous
for the city of Krac, or Harach, which in scripture is called Petra
of the XVildcrness3 and for Mount Sinai, where G-od promulgated
the law by Moses, which mountain by Ethnic writers is called
