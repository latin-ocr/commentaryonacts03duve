though living, swarmed with worms. In the Boeotios of Pausanias,
Cassander the son of Antipater, “his skin was filled with water,
and from all parts of his body, yet alive, worms broke out.” In
the Pseudomantes of Luciam, the imposter Alexander died as the
son of Podalirius, “his foot being putrefied up to the groin, and
swarming with worms.'’ Eusebius, Hist. viii. 16, says, that out of
the Emperor Galerius lWIaximianus’s bowels came out infinite
quantities of worms, which caused a deadly smell. “Dioclesian,⁷’
saith Cedrenus, “before he died, had his tongue putrefied, and
great heaps of worms came out of his jaws.'' “His body,’' saith
Eutychius Alexandrianus, of the same emperor, “was so full of
worms, that it dropped them on the ground, and his tongue, with
his jaWS‚ were consumed, and so he died.” Concerning Julian,
uncle of Julian the Apostate, whose privy members rotted off,
Sozomenus saith, lib. v. cap. 8, ‘⁶ And there the putrefied flesh was
turned into worms, and the malignity of his distemper was above
the physician's art.⁷' Nestorius also, if we may believe Evagrius‚
lib. i. cap. 1, “having his tongue eaten out with worms, passed out
of the miserics of this life, to suffer more grievous punishments,
inflicted on him by God's just judgments, and those to last to all
eternity.'’ Like to this, is that which Baronius (out of Sui-ius),
A.D. 698, relates of Dodon, who had slain Lambert the bishop of
Tongres. “All Dodon's bowels of a sudden putrefied, and he
voided them out of his mouth, stinking strangely. At length his
body being corrupted by a consumption and by worms, stank so
intolerably, that it was thrown into the Mense.” γ

He grave up the ylzost. In the fifty-fourth year of his age, the
seventh of his reign, and the fourth year of Claudius Caesar, the
fifth day after those vehement gripes, which the Lord by his
angel inflicted on him, because he had not left God's honour un-
touched, as Peter before, ch. X. 26. And Paul and Barnabas
hereafter, ch. xiv. 14, 15. The children which Herod Agrippa
left, were one son named Agrippa, about seventeen years of age,
who at that time was educated at Rome by Claudius, but he had
three daughters, of which Berenice was seventeen years old, and
married to her uncle Herod, king of Chalcis in Syria. The other
two were then virgins, lVIariamne, aged ten years, and betrothed by
her father to Julius Archelaus, the son of Chalcias3 and Drusilla,
six years old, and betrothed to Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus,
the king of Comagena, J osephus, Antiq. xix. 7.
