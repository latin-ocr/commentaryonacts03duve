19. Repent therefore. As much as to say, therefore let your
repentance be great, in regard ye have offended God. “Repent
of your errors, having found the truth. Repent of your affection
to those things which God loves not,” as Tei-tullian speaks.¹

And be convertecl. He that repenteth hath no better refuge
than the utter change of his purpose. “True repentance is to
commit nothing to be repented of, and to be sorry for it when any
such thing hath been committed. This is the satisfaction of
repentance, to root out the causes of sins, and to give no entrance
to their suggestionS,” saith Gennadius of Mai-seilles, in his book of

of his omnipotency and the omnipotency of his benignity, that
there is nothing which he will not, or cannot remit to a true
penitent,” saith Fulgentius.‘2 The same author in the same place,
a little further: ‘⁶ For such is the justice of God, that he condemns
the perverse, and saves the converted. Whence, saith he, be con-
ver'ted to me, and I will save you, Isa. xlv. 223⁹ But yet for no other
cause is God moved to pardon the converted, but out of his mere
free love which he bears to mankind. And this love, which was
as it were extinguished by their sins, is again rekindled by the
intercession and obedience of the Son of Grod, ‘⁵ who remaining
still just, was made mortal. By taking upon him the punishment
and not the guilt, he cancelled both the gnilt and the punishment,’'
