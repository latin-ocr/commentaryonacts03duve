and Scaliger, though otherwise very learned men, show themselves
very ridiculous, while he derives that name of Phoenicia from
Phinesias, and the other from Pinnek. Stephanus deduces it from
Phoenix, the son of Agenor or Neptune, by Libye. Dionysius
Periegeta asserts, that the Phoenicians owe their original to a
people that dwelt by the Red Sea3 that they first invented the
arts of navigation and astronomy, and did traffio, says he, in that
never to be enough praised treatise of his, intituled Periegesis. In
steering their course they observed Cynosura, that is, the Lesser
Bear, whereas the Grecians took their directions from Helice, that
is, the Greater Bear, as Ovid has accurately expressed both of
them.¹ The Phoenicians were the first inventors of letters, for
Cadmus is reported to have been the first that transported them
from Phoenicia into Greece3 witness Diodorus Siculus. Of our
writers Pliny speaketh thus of Phoenicia, and the inventions of
the Phoenicians: ‘Those who divide critically will have Phoenicia
to be encompassed by Syria3 that it is the maritime border of
Syria, a part of which is Idumea and J udea, then Phoenicia, finally
Syria. All the sea that lies before it has the name of the Phoc—
nician Sea. The people of Phoenicia were of great account of old,
for that they invented letters, knowledge of the stars, and naval

and military arts. Hence Lucan :Q—

Phoenicians first adventured, if wc may credit fame,

To eternize the voice, to gravet on an unpolish’d frame-
Ι am fully persuaded that those Phoenician letters were the same
which of old the Canaanites and ancient Hebrews, and the Sama-
ritans at this day use, whatever the followcrs of the Jews’ Rabbis
say to the contrary.'' Thus far Thomas de Pinedo. See what we

have said above, ch. xi. 19.
We went aboard, and set forth. That is, having got -aboard that

ship we were carried forth.
3. Now when we had discovered Cyprus. That is to say, When

the island Cyprus appeared to us, or was within the reach of our

sight. Of this island, which was inferior to none in fertility of

wine and oil, and affluence of all necessarios, see above, ch. iv. 36.
Havz’ny left it on the left Izcmd. That is, having left this famous

island of Cyprus on our left hand.
We sailed into Syria. Which the ancients divided into Phoenicia,

Palestina, and Caele, as a certain anonymous author published by

Gothofred affirms.S
