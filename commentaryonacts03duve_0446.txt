10. And Paul went down. His holy discourse being interrupted,
that he might restore Eutychus to life, who was by an unex—
pected fall killed.

And fell on lzz'm. As Elias, 1 Kings xvii. 21, and Ehsha,
2 Kings iv. 34, fell upon them whom they were about to restore
to life.

And embracius] him. Eutychus, by the middle.

Saz‘d. To them who lamented Eutychus being dead.

His lffe is z'n him. That is, now his body begins to grow warm
and revive.

11. W laen he therefore was come up aqam, Sco. As much as to
say, When therefore Paul was again gone up to that loft, where he
had preached, and had there celebrated the rite of the eucharist,
and taken meat, he with unwearied zeal spent the rest of the night
until day-light in preaching.

So. That is, the night being spent. After the same manner
the particle so is used as a note of what was done3 above, chap.
vii. 83 xvii. 33; below, chap. xxviii. 143 John viii. 59.

He departecl. From the city Troas and that on foot, the rest
being to go in a ship, as is told below, ver. 13.

12. And they brochlzt. They, to wit, who came down to take up
Eutychus, who had fallen from a window of the highest frame of
the house, brought him alive to the rest of the disciples‚ who were
assembled in the upper room whence he fell, to hear Paul preach,
and to celebrate the rite of the eucharist.

Alive. That is, marvellously restored by Paul unto life.

And were not α little comforted. As much as to say, the sight of
so great a miracle brought great comfort to all.

13. Bac we. That is, I, Luke, with others of Paul's fellow
travellers.

lVem‘ before to α ship. To go before Paul.

And sailed unto Assos. A fit port for ships. To this sea-town
of the country of Troas, the way was but short from the city
Troas, either by sea or land. Strabo saith‚1 that this was a
famous city, and upon the side that looketh to the sea, exceeding
strong both by nature and art. Pliny2 mentioneth the same city
was otherwise called Apollonia.

There intendiny to take in Paul. To wit, into the ship.

Mindiny himself to yo a foot. From Troas to Assos, a neighbour-

ing city of the same country.
