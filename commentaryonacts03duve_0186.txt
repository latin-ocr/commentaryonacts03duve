at length, in the last days, he began to speak to us by his Son,
Heb. i. 1.

32. Ι am the God, &Q Athanasius says,l “But that angel was
not the God of Abraham, but God spake in the angel, and it was
the angel that was seen, but God spake to him? The author of
the Answers to theOrthodox, in Justin Mai-tyr, Quest. 112:“ The
angels who in God’s stead appeared and spoke to men, were called
by the name of God himself, as that which spoke to Jacob, and to
Moses. Yea, men also are called gods. It is given to both by
virtue of the office enjoined them, both to be in the stead, and
bear the name of God. But when the office is fulfilled, they are
no more called gods, who only obtained that name on the account
of some work they were to do.’'

lee God of Abraham, and tlte God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. WVhen God is said to be the God of any, it is to be under-
stood [that God is] a special favourer and bountiful patron of him, as
sufficiently appears from that form of the covenant, Lev. xxvi. 12,
Ι will be your God, and με shall be my people, which Paul cites, 2 Cor.
vi. 163 and from the peculial· covenant made with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, Gen. xvii. 7, 8. Now they had some good things mea-
sured out unto them in this life, but mixed with many troubles,
For neither had they any settled place of their own, but wandered
up and down with their familics and flocks, and were also fre-
quently tossed with the injuries of men and fortune. Hence
also Jacob called himself a stranger and pilgrim, when he spoke
to Pharaoh, which the author to the Hebrews very pertinently
insisteth on, eh. xi. 13. It remains, therefore, that God was the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not only when they lived on
earth, but also when God spoke these things to Moses. For, as 1
have said, nothing had befallen them in this life which could answer
the magnificence of so great a name. But, besides, we much
more do good to him, if we can, for whose sake we do good to
others. God wants not power, and he says that he will bless their
posterity for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob3 much more,
therefore, will he do good to them. But they who are dead are
not capable of a benefit, if they are always to continue in the
state of death. It follows, therefore, that they are to be restored
unto life, as Christ from hence evinced against the Sadducees,
Matt. xxii. 323 Mark xii. 273 Luke xx. 38, that he may in a
