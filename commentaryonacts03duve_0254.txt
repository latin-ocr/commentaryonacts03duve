In a vision. Divinely excited. See what we have said above,
ch. ii. 17.

Belzold, Ι am ltere, Lord. A Hebraism, that is, Ι am ready to
receive, and do thy eommands.

11. Go into tlte street which is called Straiylzt. That is, into that
street of Damascus, which is called straight, the Greeks call it
Euthia, perhapS, because it was plainer, and straighter than any
other street of that city.

Of Tarsus. That is, born in Tarsus, in that most famous city
of Cilicia. See below, ch. xxi. 393 xxii. 3.

For behold he prayetlz. Luke shows that Saul, during his three
days’ fast, was continually taken up in praying.

12. And he laath seen a vision. To wit, Saul, with the eyes of
his mind. They are the words of Luke, telling that Saul saw
Ananias laying 1115 hands upon him at that very time, wherein the

him a scourge3 afterward having on a sudden seen Augustus,
whom, as yet being unknown to the most part of them, his uncle

before, of Q. Catulus: ‘⁶ And the next day having met Augustus,
being otherwise unknown to him, beheld him not without admira-

Thus Ovid says: “ Α5 Ι dreamed to see men by order, such do I
perceive and see by order.’' Apuleius saith,¹ “1 presently per-
ceived one of the holy priestS, beside the mark of his foot, also in
the rest of his habit and carriage agreeing exactly with a night
image, whom afterwards I knew to be called Asinus Marcellus.’'
Which places, though taken out of the writings of heathens, do
most fitly illustrate this narration. For although Luke mentions
only his name, and the laying on of hands, yet it is probable that
Saul did see Ananias, as if he did view him with his eyes, to wit,
