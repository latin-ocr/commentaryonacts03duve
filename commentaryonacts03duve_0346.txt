with any to eat of things sacrificed, those that did it should be
purged by satisfaction of penance.' So in Minutius Felix, when
Caecilius objects to the Christians, ‘That they abhorred those
pieces of meat which were taken from the sacrifices, and those
drinks wherewith there had been libations made on the altars :'
Octavius presently answers: ‘That we contemn the relies of
sacrifices, and idol-offered cups, proceeds not from fear, but is an
assertion of our true liberty3 for although everything that is
brought forth, as it is the inviolable gift of God, cannot be
corrupted by your doings‚ yet we abstain, lest any should think,
either that we give place to those devils to whom you offer, or that
we are ashamed of our religion.' Yea, Augustino shows himself
so scrupulous in eating of idolothytes, that he seems to praise a
man for choosing to starve rather than touch them 3 for thus he
writes:¹ ‘It remains that we speak something of that Christian
traveller whom you speak of, overcome with necessity of hunger,
if he can nowhere find anything but meat that is placed in an idol's
temple, and where no other person is present, whether it be better
for him to choose to die of hunger, rather than take the food for
his refreshment. In which question it doth not necessarily follow
thatssthe meat so found is offered to the idol 3 for it might, by some
travelling that way, and turning in there to refresh themselves, be
either by forgetfulness or voluntarily left behind, or set there on
some other occasion. Therefore I briefly answer: either he is
certain that the meat is idolothyta or certain that it is not, or the
same is unknown. lf he be certain it is, it is better he should,
with Christian courage, refuse it, even with manifest hazard of his
life, as the question supposes. But if he knows it is not, or is
ignorant whether it is or no, then let him take it without any
scruple of conscience for the use of his necessity.' Where it
appears that Augustine did in no wise esteem the eating of idolo-
tlzytes as a thing indifferent, and from which we are to abstain only
for fear of scandal, but looked upon it as a thing altogether evil in
itself, and to be avoided, though no man were privy thereunto.
For he supposes no other man to be present, whom there might- be
danger to offend by doing it, and yet in such a case prefers rather,
out of Christian virtue, to abstain, than to do anything unworthy
of his calling, though for saving of his life. The same did the
ancient Christians that lived amongst the pagans always judge, so
that many of them chose rather to die than to pollute themselves
