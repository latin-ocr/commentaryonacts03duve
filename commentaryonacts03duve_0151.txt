Departed from the presence of the coumz‘l rejoz‘cz'ny. By these words
is meant, that the apostles did with so much constancy of mind
endure these persecutions, that they not only did not complain, but
also greatly rejoiced. The most pious, and eminent for learning, Dr.
J. Sharp, Dean of N orwich, who formerly, by his own beneficence,
and the liberality of the Right Hon. Lord Heneage Finch, late high
chancellor of England, did frequently and largely supply my wants,
in that famous sermon made before the lord mayor and aldermen of
the city of London, upon Michaelmas day, A.D. 1680, saith most
truly and elegantly of the just man: “Let what will happen to
him, he is full of peace and joy, for he bath met with no disap-
pointment of his designs. His great aim was to please God3 and
his conscience from God's word assures him that he hath done 11,
and he hath nothing to do further, but to wait for the happy time,
when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed, and every man's
conscience and actions will be made manifest, and then he doubts
not to receive approbation and praise, and a great reward in that
day of the Lord Jesus3 and so much the rather, because this light
affliction wherewith he is now exercised, he is assured, will work for
him a far more exceeding and 01011131 weight of glory,2 Cor. iv. 17.’'

Tlmt ζήσῃ were, &c As much as to say, that they had this sin-
gular proof of the grace of God, to be afflicted for Christ’s sake,
and the propagating of his kingdom, Phil. i. 16. ‘⁶ Here,” saith
Calvin, “the cause should be respected which associates 115 with the
Son of God, who not only with his glory swallowed up the
dishonour of the world, but turned its reproaches, mockeries, and
abuses to a great honour.

42. And daz'ly, &c. As much 35 10 say, but the apostles, relying
upon the protection of Christ, nowise frighted with the adversaries’
threats or punishments did, contrary to the unjust prohibition of
the Sanhedrim, preach the gospel of Christ, not only sometimes, but
daily, not only from house to house, that is privately in every house,
but also publicly in the most famous place of the city, the temple.
‘⁶ He,'’ saith Calvin‚ ‘⁶ that accounts himself happy when he suffers
for Christ, let him never faint, though he should undergo hard
trials. For the apostles were in a manner armed with stripes, that
without fear they might hasten to death. Woe therefore to our
wantonness, who, as soon as we have suffered the least persecution,

like soldiers discharged from service, presently surrender the torch
to others.''
