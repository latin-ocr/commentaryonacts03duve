the common English translation bath, “ and falling headlong.” But
that this version may be reconciled with that of Matthew, saying,
And departiuy, lte went and laanyed himself, ch. xxxvii. 5, as the
ancient Latin interpreter renders the Greek words, some turn it
thus, ‘⁶ And departing, he was consumed with anguish of 1nind.’'
For the Greek word used there, if we may credit Heinsius, Grotius,
and Brenius, ‘⁶ is to be tormented with grief and sadness, and stop-
page of the breath, whether the person die of those torments or
no.” So that Matthew does not speak of the death of Judas,
which happened after the same manner here by St. Luke related,
but of the unsupportable torment of an exulcerated conscience3
which Chrysostom calls,¹ “to be strangled 'with conscience,” that
is, to be oppressed with the guilt of his crimes. Lightfoot renders
the Greek word in St. Matthew, “he was strangled.” And so he
believes the death of J udas happened. “ For now,” says he, ‘⁶ after
he had thrown back the price of his treason, when J udas was de-
parted with an intent-ion to return to his own family, the devil,
who dwelt in him, snatching him up into the air, strangled him,
and threw him down headlong, so that dashing against the earth,
he burst in two in the middle, his guts tunibling forth, after which
horrible exit the devil left him.'' But whereas the most ancient
author of the Epistle to the Philippians under the name of Ignatius
the martyr, ascertains hanging to be the death of Judas3 and
J uvencus affirms that he hanged himself upon a fig-tree;² and
Bede testifies that the same was to be seen in his time near Jerusa-
lem : the Vulgar Latin version of St. Matthew seems to be preferred
before the rest, which, though it seems to vary something from the
relation of Peter concerning his casting down headlong, yet does it
carry no contradiction to it. Matthew gives an account of the
beginning of the action, Peter of the end, supplying by divine
inspiration what was wanting in the relation of Matthew. J udas
fits the halter to his neck, and springs downward with the greater
violence, to the end he might the sooner choke himself. But that
the vengeance of God might more eminently appear in the hori-id
and immature death of the infamous traitor, by an unexpected
accident the rope broke, so that Judas fell headlong upon some
craggy stone, or sharp pointed stump of a tree, so that his bursten
belly let forth all his bowels. Thus Casaubon. Coneerning the
ten thousand Idumeans thrown headlong by 1116 Jews from a rock,
