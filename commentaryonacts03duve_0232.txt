37. If thou believest. That the eunuch is not permitted to be
baptized, unless he had professed a sincere faith in Christ, it doth
sufficiently enough declare how truly great Basil hath spoken in
his book on the Holy Spirit, ch. xii. “Faith and baptism are the
two means of salvation, inseparably cleaving together3 for faith is
perfected by baptism, but baptism is founded by saith, and by the
same names both things are fulfilled. For as we believe in the
F ather, Son, and Holy Spirit: so also we are baptized in the name
of the F ather, Son, and Holy Spirit3 and indeed there goeth
before a confession leading us unto salvation: but baptism fol-
loweth, sealing our confession and covenant.’' But the covenant
of Gor] is his promise of giving us eternal life, and our answer is
our promise of worshipping God according to his will revealed to
us. The same chureh's teacher, in his third book against Euno-
mius: ‘⁶ Baptism is the seal of faith3 saith is the confession of the
God-head3 it is necessary we should first believe, then be sealed
with baptism.'' According to this rule of scripture, and agreeing
with reason itself‚ the most part of the Greeks in all ages, even
unto this day, retain a custom of delaying infant baptism, till they
themselves can give a confession of their saith, as Grotius hath
noted on Matt. xix. 13. But especially the sixth canon of the
synod of N eocaesarea is to be observed, whose words are as follows:
‘⁶ Concerning a woman with child, that she may be baptized when
she pleases3 for her baptism eoneerns not her child. For everyone
is to give a demonstration of his own choice in a confession.” For
however the interpreters draw it to another purpose, it does appear
that the question was made of women big with child, because it did
seem that the child was baptized together with the mother, which,
notwithstanding, ought not, nor used not to be baptized, except of
its own proper election and profession. And to this purpose are the
words of Balsamo: ¹ “The unborn babe cannot be baptized, because
it is not come to light, neither can it have a choice in making con—
fession, which is required in hely baptism.” And Zonaras, ‘⁶ The
babe will then need baptism, when it can choose.'’ But the synod
doth determine that baptism of a woman great with child, doth
therefore rightly proceed, because her baptism concerns her alone,
who can confess what she believeth, and not the child in her womb.
But that synod of N cocaesarea was held before the first Nieene
syn0d3 for we read the name of Basil, Bishop of Amasi-a, subscribed
