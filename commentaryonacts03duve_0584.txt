564 THE AOTS or THE Hom( APOSTLES [CHAP. xxvm.

We came to Rome. That is, as it is in the English, we went
toward Rome, for then they wer-e not yet come to Rome, as is
understood by the verse immediately following. To come in this
place signifies nothing else than to 90, as Luke xv. 203 John vi. 17.

Rome, to whom Paul had written an epistle before, which is super·-
scribed, To tlze Romans.

Had heard. That Paul was going a prisoner from Puteoli to
Rome, accompanied by Luke and Aristarchus.

They met. That is, many went out to meet.

Us. To wit, who were on our journey for Rome.

As far as Appii-forum and the Three Taverns. As if he had said,
Some indeed met us at Appii-forum, but others, who set later out,
met us at the Three Taverns, which were nearer to Rome than
Appii-forum. Zozimus, lib. ii., maketh mention of the Three
Taverns, and that Severus Caesar, when he was going to Rome,
when he came to that place, which was called the Three Taverns,
he was seized by the ambush which Maxentius had set against
him in that place, and put to a cruel death, having had his neck
broke with a halter. Jerome thinks that Appii-forum was so
called from Appius, a certain consul; from whom also the way
called Appian had its name. It was a town farther distant from
Rome than the Three Taverns, as Cicero showeth, Ad Attio. lib.
ii. Epist. 10.: “From Appii-forum at four o'clock3 I had given
another a little before at the Three Taverns.’' Behind the moun-
tain Albanus, in the Appian VVay, there is a city called Aricia,
which Strabo, lib. v. saith is distant from Rome one hundred and
sixty furlongs3 but Dionysius, lib. vi. and Philostratus, lib. iii. of
the Life of Apollonius, say it is only one hundred and twenty
furlongs distance from it. But these verses of Horace plainly
prove that Aricia was nearer Rome than Appii-forum, Serm. i.
Sat. 5 :——-
