(Geog. lib. iii. cap. 1), was a colony of the Tuscans, who, before the
Romans attained the government, commanded all by land and sea,
as Livy reeordeth in his book v. ch. 3. Hadrian Caesar's pro-
genitors had their original from this city, as AElius Spartianus in
his life declareth. The same city, after the Tuscan empire was
buried in oblivion, was made a colony by the Romans, as you may
see in the Epitome of Livy, lib. xi. From this city also the sea,
which by the Greeks is called, Ἀδριάτικον πέλαγος, 61· Ἀδρίας
κόλπος, 1116 Latius call the Adriatic, or Adrian Sea, or Gulf.
The poets also call it Adria, after the manner of the Greeks, and
Adriaeum, which anciently was called Atriacum ; as also the city
Atria, as Pliny reports, lib. iii. cap. 16, in these words:—-“ The
Tuscans began to make first out of Sagis all these rivers and
ditches, diverting 1116 impetus of the river into the Adrian marshes,
which are called the Seven SeaS, and made a famous haven of
Atria, a town of the Tuscans, from whence that was before called
the Atriatie‚ which now is called the Adriatic Sea.” Pliny
speaketh of the river Po, which the Greeks eall Eridanus, which
emptied twenty rivers, with itself, into the sea. But whether
Adria and Atria were the same city, we leave to the learned to
judge. Stephan. Byzantius thinketh that they were different
cities, for he mentions each of them in their peculiar place ; but it
is usual with him to make two of one and the same city, as Thomas
de Pinedo hath observed. But this 15 certain from Strabo, Ovid,
Statius, and Ptolemy, that not only that gulf which lies betwixt
Venice and Corcyra is called Adria, or Adrian, and most usually
Adriatic, but that that name is extended even to the Ionian Sea.
“ Therefore,'’ saith Grotius, ‘⁶ Procopius calls the sea reaching from
Methon 16 Sicily, and elsewhere from Cephalenia to Calabria, by
the name of Adria, and in another place he makes a part of it the
Gulf of Adria3 and expressly in his first of the Vandals, he placeth
as well Gaulon as Melite, in Adria.”

leat some country appeared to sltem. In the Greek, προσάγειν
τινὰ αὐτοῖς χώραν, “ that some country drew near them.'' A kind
of speech peculial· to mariners, because to their sight, when sailing,
the land seems to come near, or depart from them, when they in
their voyages draw near to land, or make from it. Such is that of
Virgil, AEn. 111. ver. 72 :—

We launch, aul fill the strands,
And sall from cities, and retreating lands.
