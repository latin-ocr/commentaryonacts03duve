prisoner from Jerusalem. That is, since the time that the Jews
would have killed me at Jerusalem, as a wicked man and one un-
worthy to live. See above, ch. xxi. 31, 33.

Ι was delivered into tlte hands qf the Romans. Who governed
J udea. See above, ch. xxiii. 24.

18. Who. To wit, the Roman procurators of J udea, viz. Felix,
ch. xxiv„ and Festus, ch. xxv.

When they lzad examined me. That is, when they had made in-
quisition into, and taken cognizance of my cause.

Would have Zet me 90. Greek, ἐβοῦλοντο ἀπολῦσαι, “would have
absolved, or set me at liberty.'' That is, they were strongly bent to
set me free, as before Pilate was to set Christ at liberty, when he
was delivered to him. See above, ch. xxiv. 283 xxv. 18, 25.

Because there was no cause of death in me. That is, because they
acknowledged that I had done nothing worthy of death. Claudius
Lysias, the chief captain, acknowledged above, ch. xxiii. 29, that
Paul had done nothing that deserved to be punished by death. As
also Felix, governor of Judaea, when he treated him kindly, above,
ch. xxiv. 243 Festus, the governor, who succeeded Felix, ch. xxv.
18, 25 3 King Agrippa the younger, ch. xxvi. 32. So the servant,
no less than the Lord, had a testimony of his innocency from these
unbelievers.

19. But when tlze Jews spake ayaz'nst it. Who dealt with Festus
to send me from Caesarea to Jerusalem, to be there judged by the
Sauhedrim, that they might have a fit opportunity to kill me by
the way. See above, ch. xxv. 3.

I was constraz'ned. Lest I should have been sent from Caesarea
to Jerusalem by Festus, who was willing to gratify the Jews. See
above, ch. xxv. 19.

To appeal to Coesar. See above, ch. xxv. 11.

Not that, &c. As if he had said, Yet not upon this account, that
I might accuse the Jews, that without cause troubled me, of any
crime, before the Roman emperor, but only that I might vindicate
my own innocency. Beza has here supplied the ellipsis of the
particle, “yet,'' rendering, “yet not that,” and he hath taken notice
of the like ellipsis of the same particle, Matt. ii. 6.

20. For this cause therefore. As if he had said, Lest ye should
think I am disaffected towards my own nation.

Have I entreated to see you, and speak with you. That is, I have
humbly prayed that ye would visit me, that I might have occasion
to discourse with you.
