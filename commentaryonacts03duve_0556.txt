drink, is said, Matt. xi. 18, neither eatinfs nor drz‘nkz'ny. See what
we have said in our literal explication on that place.

34. therefbre, 810. Here Paul's exhortation is expressed, from
whence we may again observo, that his judgment waS, that means
were not to be neglected, but were to be made use of, although he
nothing doubted but that God, as he had bountifully promised,
would preserve all those who were in the ship with him by his
favour, so that not one of them should perish in the shipwreck.

For your health. That is, that your former strength, that is
impaired by your tasting, may be repaired. If they had not
refreshed their strength with food, they had not been able to
endure labour, nor to swim out in the approaehing shipwreek.

For. If ye follow my advice.

There shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you. A pro-
verbial kind of speech, whereby it is signified, that they should not
suffer the least damage. The like speech is to be seen, 1 Sam. xiv.

them by his example to shake off the fear of death, and take food

eat gave thanks, Matt. xiv. 193 xv. 363 John vi. 11.

In presence (gf them all. Showing an example which they might
follow.

And when he had broken. That sea or eoarse bread3 which being
broad and not very thick, was rather broken than eut with kniveS,

He heyam to eat. That is, he ate3 a Hebrsszism very usual in
scripture of which we have spoken above, ch. i. 1.

encouraged by Paul's words and example, of the truth of whose
predictions they had already had experience, laying aside all cares
and removing sadness a little from their hearts.

They also took meat. To appease their craving stomaehs.
Pertinently says Petronius, “Nono unwillingly hears when he is
either urged to take meat, or to live.''
