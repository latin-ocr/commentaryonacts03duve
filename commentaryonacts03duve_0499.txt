31. Brouylzt him by niqht. To wit, the same night in the which
they who were to carry Paul to Felix the procurator or vice-
governor of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, set out on their journey
from «Jerusalem to Caesarea at the third hour.

To Antipatris. The apostle was ordered to be carried to Caesarea
by the command of the chief captain, as above, ver. 23. But be-
cause that Caesarea, which is situate by the sea, and is commonly
called Caesarea of Palestine, and lies within the limits of the half
tribe of Manasseh, is distant from Jerusalem thirty leagueS, which
could not be travelled over in one night, they rested first at Anti-
patris, which was anciently called Capharsaba, as Josephus testi-
fieth, ¹ and, as some will have it, it is the same city with that called
Capharsalama.2 The same «Iosephus telleth us,³ that the distance
betwixt Joppa and Antipatris is one hundred and fifty furlongs,
that is, seventeen miles. He also saith,⁴ that this beautiful and
pleasant city was built by Herod the Great in a large field called
Capharsaba, in a watery ground and excellent soil, encompassed
with trees and a river, and called Antipatris, after the name of his
father. And, book i. chap. xvi. of the WVars of the Jews, speaking
of the cities and edifices, repaired and built by Herod the Great, he
saith, as Ruffinus Aquileiensis interprets him, “He built a city in
the best field of the kingdom, in memory of his father, very rich in
rivers and trees, and called it Antipatris.” Antipatris which lies
west from the river Jordan, is mentioned by Ptolemy the geo-
grapher? among the cities of Judea. I cannot therefore conceive
on what ground and by what authority they commonly ascribe it
to the half tribe of Manasseh, which is on this side of Jordan, and
will have it situate almost in the middle of Samaria.

32. On tlze mort-ow. To wit, of that night in the which Paul,
defended with a guard of soldiers, was brought to Antipatris, when
now they were got a great way from Jerusalem, where they were
who had entered into a conspiracy to kill Paul.

They left tlze hor—semen to 90 wz'tlz him. To Caesarca. A guard of
horse was sufficient to defend him from the ordinary hazards that
were incident in journeys.

And they returned. The two hundred footmen that were heavily
armed, and the same number of spearmen.
