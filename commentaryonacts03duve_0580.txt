Jupiter Olympus. The third part of the city was named Tyche‚
because it was an ancient temple of Fortune (so the Greeks call
Fortune) in which there was a spacious college, and very many
consecrated houses. But the fourth part, because it was built
last, was called Neapolis, in which there was a large theatre, and
two stately temples, the one Ceres's, the other Proserpina’s, and
that surpassingly beautiful and big image of Apollo, which they
called Temenites. These four parts of Syracuse were of that extent,
that Cicero, in the above cited, place calls every one of them a city,
and therefore Ausonius in his poems, which he made of the 'most
considerable cities of the Roman empire, calls Syracuse Quadruple.
Epipolas also, wherein wcre Euryleus, Labdalum, and Temenus, of
which we have spoke in their proper places, is by others mentioned
among the parts of Syracuse, but we have 'followed the most
learned of Romulus’s offspring, from whose fountain we have
watered these gardens. In Epi polis was that famous prison called
Latomiae, a large and stately work of kings and tyrants3 it was all
of a roek digged to a marvellous depth, according to Cicero's Ora-
tion against Verres, lib. v., who in the same oration avers that it
was made by Dionysius the cruel tyrant. The pleasantest of these
caverns had its name of Philoxenus the poet, wherein he is said to
have composed Cyclops, the choicest of all his poems, as AElian
reporteth, Hist. Var. lib. xii. cap. 44. Suetonius saith, in Tib. cap.
74, that that image of Apollo, called Temenites, so much com-
mended by Cicero, was transported from Syracuse to Rome. The
Romans made themselves masters of this most opulent and famous
city, when NIarcellus was their general, after that they had sacked
it, as Livy in his twenty-fifth book, and Florus, lib. ii. cap. 6,
sufficiently testify3 the words of the latter I thought fit to insert
here. Sicily, that was committed to Marcellus, did not long hold
out, for all the island was overcome in one city. That great, and
before that time invincible metropolis, Syracuse, though it was
defended by Archimedes's wit, at last submitted. Its triple wall,
the same number of castles, that marble haven, and celebrated
fmmtain, availed it nothing, save only to procure compassion, that
being overcome it might be spared for its beauty. Strabo, lib.
vi„ saith, that Augustus Caesar repaired it. It was anciently the
metropolis of all Sicily, as also the greatest and most powerful seat
of tyrants, now a bishop’s scat, between Catcna and the promon-
tory Pachynus3 it retains the same situation at this day, and its
name is a little altered, fer it is commonly called Saragossa.
