God. Therefore as being now deprived of their leader Moses,
they ask visible gods which may go before them. Moreover, if
we may give credit to the Tanchuma, fol. 46, those men who asked
this were not Israelites, but the forty—thousand men who went up
out of Egypt with the Israelites, and the two Egyptian magicians,
J annes and Jambres by name. But these are but foolish inventions
to vindicate their ancestors from the crime of idolatry, when none
who has not quite lost his senses but may smell out their deceit.
For if instead of 175ᾫρἤὲ we read miz> ³⁸2, the sentence will be in-
coherent, nor will these words agree in the least with the follow-
ing. Resides it supposes, that in Moses' time the days were
divided into hours, which is plainly contradictory to all history.
For other nations have learned the division of the day into twelve
hom-s, invented by the Babylonians, long after, as we are informed
by Herodotus, and others, this especially is to be considered, that
if Moses by divine instinct did foretell at what time he would
return, he returned at the very moment he appointed, nor was

Israe13 ver. 13, The seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 3 ver. 14,
The people of God. Ther-efore the Levites when they executed
vengeance to punish the guilty, did not kill only strangers, but their
brethren, sons, friends, neighbours, sparing none that came in their
way3 because the guilt was universal. With good reason there—
fore does Stephen upbraid the Jews with this, that their fathers
said to Aaron, Make us yocls, &c.

the people desired that they might have an idol made after the
manner of the Egyptian superstition, Aaron, whether overeome
with fear, or some other preposterous affection, hearkening to the
mad multitude, contrary to the express words of the law, Exod.
xx. 23, commanded them all, without respect to sex, to bring their
ear-rings, and when they were brought melted them in a vcssel fit
