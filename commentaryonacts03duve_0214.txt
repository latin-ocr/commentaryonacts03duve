Were seattered ahroad throzcyhozct the countries qs* Judea and
Samaria. That is, through the towns and villages of Samaria,
strictly so called. Some of these believers so scattered abroad,
not long after went unto Damascus, below chap. ix. 19, 25,
among whom was Ananias, a religious man according to the law,
and having a testimony of all the Jews that dwelt thereabouts3
below, chap. xxii. 12. Some went unto Rome itself peradventure,
and among these Andronicus and Junius, kinsmen of Saul the
persecutor, and who before him embraced the faith of Christ,
Rom. xvi. 7. Some finally went even unto Phoenice, Cyprus, and
Antioch, preaching the word of the Lord unto the Jews only,
below, cha-p. xi. 19, to those, viz.‚ that were scattered abroad in
those places among the nations, J ames i. 1 ; 1 Pet. i. ].

Except tlte apostles. Who stayed at Jerusalem, that with an
invincible constancy they might there profess themselves to be the
witnesses and preachers‚ by the special appointment of God, of
those things which they did assuredly know by hearing and seeing
of Christ, the Saviour of mankind.

2. They took care, &a¹ As if he should have said, The devout
men took care of Stephen's burial together, and did witness both
by words and great store of tears, how grievously and bitterly
they took his death, who did in no ways deserve it at their hand.
Which, notwithstanding, it is not once to be doubted but that they
did do it moderately enough, seeing they were well acquainted with
the precepts of Christ, which among other things also did forbid
immoderate grief. See 1 Thess. iv. 13.

3. Saul, &c. Luke returneth again to describe the persecution
of the faithful of the church of Jerusalem, as if he should have
said, In so great outrageousness of the bloody Jews against the
church of Christ, Saul did more waste it than the rest: for having
received power from the Sanhedrim, not only when the saints
were put to death by him did he give his voice against them, but
also he, entering into every house, and hailing thence both men
and women, did bind them and commit them into prison, and did
beat them often through all synagogues, and so for fear he forced
some to blaspheme by denying Christ 3 he persecuted others, con-
stant in the faith, to death. So cruel and furious is the vehemency
of the zeal which is not according to knowledge. See below,
