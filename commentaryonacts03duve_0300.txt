Antioch, and by them to the whole church.

Separate me, &c. The Holy Ghost bids to separate Barnabas
and Saul, not to the Lord, but to himself 3 whereby is meant that
the Lord and the Holy Ghost hath the same virtue and power3
which, if he were less than the Lord, he would have said, Sepa-
rate Saul and Barnabas to the Lord, or to God. He commands
them to be separated to him for that to which he himself called
thern. He therefore constituted them ministers to himself, he calls
them his own servants. But as we cannot be men's servants in
such things as concern religion and conscience, so neither can we
be the servants of angels: for the same reason which Paul adduces,
1 Cor. vii. 23: ἵε are bouylzt wz'tlz a price, be με not the servants
qs* men, militates against both these services. The servant of men
there is opposed to the servant of Christ, who subjects his whole
self, soul and body, to him ; for he redeemed us, and addicted us to
his service, by the price of his own blood. He who thus is the
servant of Christ, cannot in the sanie sense be the servant of rnen ;
he is therefore bound by Christ for his servant. So for the sanie
reason he cannot be the servant of angels, who are our fellow
servants. Therefore the Holy Ghost, who so bound Paul and
Barnabas to his own service, is not an angel, nor a company of
angels, but Lord of all, “ who hath the same worship and glory
with the Father and the Son,’' as the fathers of the second
oecumenic council at Constantinople say in the symbol of that
council.

For tlte work, &c. That work which they ought to do for the
Holy Ghost is described in this chapter and the next, unto the
26th verse, where they are said to have fulfilled that work. They
were sent by the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel, and bring
many to the obedience of the saith. This work is peculiarly the
work of the Holy Ghost, who is the author, and useth to be
called the worker of saith, which yet is the gift of God, Eph. ii. 8 ;
therefore the Holy Spirit is God‚ which worketh and produceth
that faith in the saints, and so the whole work of regeneration, by
the superabundant riches of his grace.
