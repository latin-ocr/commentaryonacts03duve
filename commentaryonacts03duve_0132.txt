5. And Ananias lzearz'nq these words. And not being able to
endure their sharpness, as Origen excellently noteth.¹

Fell down, aad qaue up the yhost. Ananias and Sapphira fell
dead at Peter's feet, because that mocking the apostles, inspired by
the Holy Ghost, they mocked the Holy Ghost, or Gocl himself.
So Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, were swallowed up by the earth,
because they rose up against Moses, N umb. xvi. And of those
children, mentioned 2 Kings ii. 24, two she-bears out of the wood
destroyed forty and two, not so much for mocking Elisha as bald,
as for mocking him being the prophet of the true God. Also
Elymas for resisting Paul is struck with blindness, Acts xiii. 11.
Now, whether Ananias and Sapphira were by the righteous
judgment of God condemned to eternal punishment, seeing scrip-
ture is altogether silent, we cannot determine. Tertullian and
Ambrose affirm it, Origen and some other fathers deny it3 but we
judge it pious ignorance to be willing not to know what God was
not willing to make known to us.

And yreat feczr came upon, &Q As much as to say, As many as
heard that God punished the lying and hypocrisy of Ananias with
sudden death, were seized with great reverence to the majesty of
God, that they might very earnestly shun the heincus offences so
punished.

6. And the young] men arose. Supply ‘⁶ who were of lusty
bodies,'’ as Apuleius speaks.

And carried lzz'm out. The Greek word for carried lcz'm out,
signifies, “they trussed him together,” because, as the famous
Lightfoot saith, “ They not having grave-clothes ready, they
trussed the dead body together as well as they could, and having
carried him thence, buried him.’'

7. His wg‘f'e not knowz'nq what was done. Hence Lightfoot
observes the reason why the Greek word “ to truss together‚'' is
used in the verse preceding. ‘⁶ For if,” saith he, “they who
carried him out of the room, where he fell down dead, had carried
him to his o'wn house or lodging, there to get him a winding sheet,
his wife could not be ignorant of what had come to pass3 but,
συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν, they bound and trussed him up as he was in
his clothes, and so carried him out, and buried him.’'

Came in. That is, where Peter and the rest of the believers
were gathered together.
