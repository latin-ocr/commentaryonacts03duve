and ruled over so many nations, that by reason of the vastness of
their empire, they were almost equal in power to the Romans.¹

tidius Bassus, according to Gellius‘2 Extraordinary was their
manner of fight‚ therefore famous among the poets, for they fought

Parthos, or Parthus, is also the name of an Illyrian city, whose
inhabitants are called Partheni. But Parthus was a province of
Macedonia, whose inhabitants, according to Ptolemy, called by the
