being 'gone into heaven, shall there remain till all the prediotions of
the prophets shall be fulfilled3 and those being fulfilled, he shall
return from heaven to earth to judge the quiek and the dead.

Since the world heyam. That is, of old, of ancient times, Isa.
lxiv. 43 Jer. ii. 20.

22. For IlIoses, &e Although this place in the first and more
gross sense may be understood from Dent. xviii. 15 of any prophet
endued with foreknowledge, whom God should raise up at any
time, after 1110505, among the people, to the end they might obey
him, as speaking by a divine inspiration, so he did not seduee
them from the worship of the true God, and from true piety3
yet, in the more exquisite and mystioal sense, it contains the pro-
pheoy of Christ, the Head and Chief of all the prophets, to whom
all the rest were but forerunners3 and than whom there was none
more glorified, by those signs by which God was pleased to have
his prophete distinguished. Which mystieal sense of this place, in
the time of Christ and his (lisoiples, was also admitted by the
Jews, as appears by this text, and below, 011. vii. 34, and by many
places of the gospel, and particularly by the words of the Sama-
ritan, and those other of the people who were about to crown
Christ, John iv. 25, vi. 14, This is really thot prophet thot should
come into the world. For the Messiah was properly understood by
him that should come, Luke vii. 19.

A Prophet. That 15, one who shall‘proelaim to men the will of
God, as yet concealed in mystery.

Shall the Lord your God mise. That is, shall the Lord your
God give, present, send.

Of your brethren. As much to say, Not a stranger, but one of
your own nation, born of the posterity of Israel, and your relation
by the tie of blood and kindred.

Lilce unto me. So the Jews, comparing the Messiah with Moses,
spe-ak in these wordS, 1 ‘⁶ As the first Redeemer, so shall be the last
Redeemer.” But Christ was not only like to Moses for the
wisdom of his doctrine and the greatness of his miracles, but he
exceeded him also in honour and glory.

Him shall με hear. That is, ye shall believe in all his promises,
and obey all his commandments. Therefore are none of the
sayings of Christ to be called in question, nothing to be omitted
which he commanded, nor anything to be altered at men's pleasure.
