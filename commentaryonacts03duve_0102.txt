Luke iii. 35. Hence the Syriae and Arabio interpreters under-
standing that the Greek ὅπως ἂν joined only in this text the
second proposition with the first, they have translated it by the
copulative, ‘⁶ and,” thus, “And the times may come that ye may
have rest from the sight of God, and he may send to you J esus
Christ, who was prepared for y0u.'' The sense is, That your sins
registered in the memory of God being utterly defaeed, the day
of refrigeration, that is, of consolation, may shine upon yon.
As he is said to burn with grief, who is affiicted with a sharp
sense of pain, so is he said to be refrigeratos] when consolation

Thus far Lightfoot.

favour of God. The famous Knatchbull renders it, “From the
anger of the Lord.” And so refrigeration from the presence of
God seems to be the same as a fiight from his wrath to come,

And lze shall send. The construction requires that, with the
most learned Ludovieus de DIeu, Heinsius, and Lightfoot‚ after
the Syriae and Arabio interpreters, we render the Greek aorist in
this place by the present tense, “may sends That ΞΒ, may reveal
