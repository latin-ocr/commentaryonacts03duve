elders had debated it and given their advice, being ratified by the

To the brethrem &c. The epistle is addressed to the uncir-
cumcised brethren which were in Antioch, the metropolis of Syria,
and in the rest of that country elsewhere, and in Cilicia a region
next to Syria, in Tarsus the chief city whereof, Paul, who was
born there, having been conversant since his conversion to Christ,
as appears before, ch. ix, 30, and xi. 25, it is not to be doubted
but he had there converted many to the Christian saith. But that
which they write to those amongst whom the contest about keeping
the Mosaical rites began, was to serve for the instruction of all
other Gentiles embracing the faith of Christ„ in the like case, and
therefore it is said afterwards, ch. xvi. 4, of Paul and Silas, that
as they passed through the cities, where there were Christian
churches, they delivered to them those decrees, which had been
established by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem with
the consent of the whole church, to be observed. For those were
not only cities of Syria and Cilicia, but of many other provinces.
And Paul writes to the Corinthians of the same matter, 1 Cor.
viii. 10, yea even at this day, and to all Christians wheresoever,

monies of Moses’s law: nor is there any such notable place in the
whole New Testament where the same is so expressly and pro-
fessedly taught.

Greetz'ny. In Greek, χαίρειν, “ ΤΟ rejoice.'' The forms of
salutations among the Greeks, at the beginning of their epistles,
are these: χαίρειν, “ to rejoice,” ὑγιαίνειν, “to be well,'’ and
ἐυπρίιττειυ, “to do well;’' the first referring to the mind, the
second to the body, and the last to external things 3 but before all
of them, is implied or understood ἐὐχεται, or ἐὐχοινται, such a one,
(or they who write the epistle) “desires or wishes.” Instead of
which, the Latins for the most part use salutem, “ greeting,” and
the Hebrews mbr), “peace,'’ comprehcnding in one word all felicity
and prosperity, and all good things as well of the mind as of the
body, and also those which are called the goods of fortune. Horace
imitates this Graecism in that epistle which begins Celso qaudere.
