testimonies of the prophets here, which Peter made use of to the
Jews3 but he produceth the testimony of Aratus, “for we are his
offspring,” not naming him indeed, but what was more fit to per-
suade them, “As,'' saith he, “certain also of your own poets have
said.” Though I suspect the word poets hath been added by later
authors: for this reason, that the most- ancient author Irenaeus,
citing this place does not add poets, nor yet Augustine. Now
observe with what prudence he accommodates this testimony of
Aratus to his purpose: if God be not far from every one of us,
by whose favour we live and breathe, he is not then visible or
corporeal, or perceptible by any sense, far less then our souls are,
seeing he is as it were the soul of our soul. Then, if we be his
children, it becomes us not, being children, to have low thoughts
of so great a Father: for it is certain the soul is the far nobler part
of man, without which the body is nothing: but the body of man
is better by far than images of wood, stone, brass, silver, gold, in
which there is no sense of any thing, nor motion, neither were they
made by God, but by the tradesman3 therefore they who worship
images, they have that for a god which is viler than the basest
part of man. Ye see with how much caution, and with how much
temperance, he demonstrates the worshipping of images not to be
religion, but superstition. Certainly here was room to be incensed
at the blindness of the Athenians, who having learned these things
from their authors, yet would worship dead and dumb things
instead of God. Yet neither here doth he speak any sharp word:
116 refers the madness of former ages to the times, and God’s wink-
ing at them, that he might excuse what had been done heretofore,
by the ignorance in which God suffered men to be blinded for a
time3 only that they might now repent at the shining light of the
gospel. Neither does he properly here direct his discourse to the
Athenians, but speaks in general that he might the less offend.
“ That all men,’' saith he, “might every where repent3 ’' 116
showeth that a pardon for what was past was ready for such as
would betake themselves to better3 otherwise that severe judg-
ment was near to such as would despise so great a favour from
God. Neither doth he speak thus, We declare to you that God’s
judgment is at hand, and that they ought to flee to repentance;
but- God, declares. No mention is made as yet of Christ, of whom
they had no knowledge. Now a natural way of teaching begins
with known things. Here observe, Paul who in liis Epistles with
so loud a truinpet personated the majesty of Christ, how sparingly
