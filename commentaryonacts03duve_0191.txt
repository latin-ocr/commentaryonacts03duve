that it began to be in use before the Israelites went up out of
Egypt, is plain from Exod. viii. 26 (in the edition of the Hebrew
bible by Athias, ver. 22); where, when Pharaoh or Amenophis,
father to Sethosis or Ramessis and Armais, said unto Moses and
Aaron, “ Go and sacrifice to your God in this land,’' they answered,
that they should sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians, that
is, sheep and oxen, which the Egyptians abused to abominable
idolatry. For the sacred writers used to call the idols of the
Gentiles abominations, as you may see, Dent. vii. 25, xii. 30, 31 3
2 Kings xxii. 13 ; Ezra ix. 13 Isa. xliv. 19; or, the abomination
of the Egyptians, that is, a sacrifice which the Egyptians will
abhor, who will never suffer those living creatures which they wor-
ship, to be killed for an offering3 and in this sense the Vulgate
and Chaldee interpreters understand it. The Egyptians also
erected in their temples the statues of those living creatures which
they worshipped when alive. Pomponius Mela, lib. i.‚ cap. 9,
saith, “ They adore the statues of many living ereatures, but
much more the living oreatures themselves.'' Strabo, lib. 17,
where he speaks of their temple, saith, “But no image, or at least
not in the likeness of a man, but that of some beast.⁷' And
therefore king Myccrinus hid his daughter in the cavity of a
wooden OX, covered with gold, to which the Saites daily sacrificed
by burning all sorts of sweet-smelling things.l And Stephanus,
de Urbibus, on the word busiris saith, “ It is commonly reported
that Isis buried Osiris there, laying him in a wooden ox, and
therefore the city was called Busosiris.’' “He will have,'’ saith
the most famed Bool1a1·t,‘2 ‘⁶ Osiris, buried there by his mother Isis,
to have been shut up in a wooden ox, whence the city was first
called Busosiris, and then afterward by contraction Busiris. There-
fore that learned man is mistaken, who affirms that the Egyptians
worshipped only live animals, not their effigies, and that the images
of oxen are nowhere read to have been made use of in their wor—
ship. hIoreover, that the Israelites, while they were in bondage
to the Egyptians, did also serve their gods, -Joshua xxiv. 14 3 Ezekiel
xx. 7, ὃς xxiii. 3, 8, expressly testify. From whence it seems to
follow that the Israelites imitated the customs of the Egyptians,
when they worshipped the molten golden calf in the wilderness.’'
To which the words of Stephen, in this and the following verse,
have a very near reference, T lzez'r laem-ts turned back (φαίη into
