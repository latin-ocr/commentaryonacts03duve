them. Hence saith Eustathius‚ it was by the Attics translated to
those beggars that went about the markets, that they might gather
what dropped from the sacks and thereby feed. Hence it is used
as a reproach upon men of no esteem, who are despised by all.
Paul then is called by the Athenian philosophers, spermoloqus, not
as a babbler‚ ‘⁶ who,'' as Gellius saith, ‘⁶ comes off with moist and
slippery words, without any respect to matter 3⁹³ but as a man of a
low fortune, and very meanly clothed. As much as to say, what
will that vile fellow say?

He seemetlz to be α secter fbrtlc of strcmye qocls. These unclean
spirits, which the ethnics esteem and worship as gOdS, are called
in the scripture demonia, which is their honourable name in Greek,
as if ye would call them knowing and wise, because of the
eracles given by them. Indeed, the title of knowing doth admi-
rably agree with the history of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, Gen. iii. Moreover, among the same Athenians, Socrates the
philosopher was also accused of old that he did take away the

Pagus, Panis Pagus, Neptuni Pagus, Mercurii Pagus. Areo-
Pagus was named from Mars, who in Greek is called Ἄρης, as
much as to say, the hillock of Mars, because there at first, hIars
having killed Halirrhothius, Neptune’s son, being summoned as
guilty of death, answered his charge, as saith Pausanias3 or be-
cause it was consecrated to Mars, that Mars’s temple should be
there, as Saturn’s, Pan’s‚ Neptune's, and Mercury’s were in the other
four. The judgments instituted by Cecrops the first king of
Athens, about weighty crimes and causeS, were exercised in Areo-
Pagus by the judges. Hence Hesychius: ‘⁵ Areo-Pagus at Athens
is a tribunal in its castle.” The castle in Athens was called by its
proper name, Acropolis and Polis, as the most learned Thomas de
Pinedo hath observed. Juvenal¹ calls its tribunal, Curia Martis.
Upon which place Thomas Farnabius says, that the judges of that
