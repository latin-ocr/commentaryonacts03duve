To Damascus. pinis-21, or, as it is read, l Chron. xviii. 5, τᾭᾩᾏῗῐ,
Damascus, or, Damascus, a most famous city of old, the head and
royal seat of Syria, surnamed Damascena, as the most eloquent of
the prophets, Isaiah vii. 8, witnesseth. It was situated below
Mount Hermon, from whence flowed two rivers, Amana or Abana,
and Parpar or Parphar, which Stephanus Byzantius calls Bardinis3
the rest of the Greeks seem to call it Chrysorrhoas. Amana ran
through the midst of the city, but Parpar did glide without the
city, as Benjamin Tudelensis witnesseth in his Itinerary. There is
also mention made of these two rivers, 2 Kings v. 12. See our
literal explanation upon Amos i. 5. The builder of Damascus
lieth in the grave of antiquity, notwithstanding that Josephus
said,1 that Uz, the son of Aram, and grandson of Shem built it.
J creme also, in his questions upon Genesis, where he enumerates
the posterity of Shem, speaks as if he were of the same opinion.
But a little after, speaking of Eliezer of Damascus, Abraham's

was both built and named.⁷’ The same in the beginning of his
seventh book upon Isaiah: ‘⁶ We read first the name of Damascus
in Genesis, who before Isaac was born in Abraham⁷s house, and
was esteemed his heir,²if Sarah had not had a son by the promise.
It is expounded either a kiss of blood, or a drinker of blood, or
the blood of hair cloth.'' “But if,” saith the same author, upon
Ezek. xxvii„ ‘⁶ Damascus be interpreted a drinker of blood, and
that tradition of the Hebrews be true, that the field in which the
parricide Cain slew his brother Abel, was in Damascus, whence
the place was marked with this name, then Paul with just cause
went to Damascus after the slaughter of Stephen, the first martyr
for Christ, that lie-might bring the believers in Christ bound to
,Jerusalem 3⁹² that, to wit, he in the same place might imitate the
deeds of Cain towards Abel's followers. Damascus bred a good
