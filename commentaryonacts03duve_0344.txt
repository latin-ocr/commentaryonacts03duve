tain those texts, 1 Cor. x. 20, 213 The thinys which tlte Gentiles
saerfflce, they sacrssfi'ee to devils, and not to G0d; but I would not
that με should have fellowslzzp with devils,· ye cannot drink the
cup of tlte Lord aad tlte cup of .devils,· ye cannot be partakers of
the Lords table (md qf tlte table of devils. Where we may see, that
the apostle did not look upon it as an indifferent action, and lawful
out of the case of scandal, to eat of these things in the idol's
temple, but as a most wicked thing, and for which there could be
no good plea. But you will say, what then is the meaning of
those word-s, 1 Cor. viii, 9, 11; But take heed lest tlzis liberty qs
yours [of eating idolothytes] become a stambliny bloek to the weak,
&c.‘? I answer, the apostle so speaks by way of concession, in
respect of those who boasted of their knowledge, and did defend an
action unworthy of believers, viZ, their sitting down to meat with the
Gentiles in the idol's temple, with this vain pretext, that they knew
that an idol was nothing, and therefore by that which was nothing
they could not be defiled3 whose reasonings the apostle here meets
with thus: Be it as you say, yet you ought to abstain from those
idol-f'easts, if it be but for the sake of your weak brethren, who,
perhaps, do not >so well as you understand that an idol is nothing,
and to them you may administer ²¹: most dangerous stumbling-block
or scandah and therefore in frequenting such feasts you sin against
your brethren, whom you cast into peril of eterna] damnation, and
also against Christ himself, who has redeemed them with his death.
As for my own part, I am far otherwise minded, for l would ab·
stain for ever, not only from those sacrifices, but even from the
eating of any sort of flesh whatsoever, rather than offer any offenee
to my brother. Paul, therefore, for a double cause, would have
Christiane refrain the feasts of heathens kept in their idol temples3
first, because they were in themselves evil, and none could be
present thereat without approbation, or seeming to join therein3
and secondly, because by going thither they gave grievous offence
to weak brethren. But this last reason he presses chiefly, l Cor.
viii„ referring the other unto ch. X„ where so vehemently (as we
have scen) he thunders against those ethnic banquetS, charging
such as haunt them to be partakers of the table and cup of devils.
And the apostle seems to have fallen into this discourse from an
occasion administered by the Corinthians themselves, who had con-
sulted him by an epistle, 1 Cor. vii. 13 viii. 13 et seq„ touching cer-
tain matters, and particularly concerning mcats offered to idols3
and, perhaps, how the decree of the apostles not long before made
