hast ruled J udea. This was now the tenth year of his administra-
tion of Judea, according to the universally learned Usher, arch-
bishop of Armagh. See our annotations above on ch. xxiii. 24.
But Felix, who was procurator of J udea, Samaria, and Galilee, is
called by Paul a judge‚ according to the Hebrew custom of speak-
ing, who call any governor, especially one that was endowed with
power of life and death, judge. So of old, they who had the
supreme power over the people of Israel before the institution of
kings, were called judges. And ῑῦὶὲῐὶῤ, “to judge,’' is by the Hebrews
used to signify to govern.

I do the more elzeleuZly. That is, boldly and freely.

Answerfor myself. That is to say, I will defend myself who am
hunted with calumnious accusations, with the protection of in-
nocence.

11. Because that thou, muyest understand. That. is, search the
matter by witnesses.

Thac there are yet but twelve (lays. Completed but this very day
wherein I plead my cause before thee.

Since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. That iS, since I
went from this maritime town Caesarea to Jerusalem, to celebrate
there the feast of Pentecost, and to worship God, with the rest of
the Jews in the temple, reverently and holily. There were but
twelve days intervened from Paul's arrival at Jerusalem till that
very day which was the next after his accusation, arrived at
Caesarea, wherein he pleaded before Felix, they being to be
reckoned from ch. xxi. 17, 18, 263 xxii. 303 xxiii. 12, 303 xxiv. 1.

12. Ami they neither found me in the temple. As if he had said, Not
only in these so very few dayS, which I as a stranger and sojourner
passed at Jerusalem, there could not be any such sedition stirred up
by me, as they falsely accuse me of 3 but not so much as the sus-
picion of it agrees to me, nor can any without prejudice to the
truth say, that I, at Jerusalem, either stirred up the people any
where to tumultuous assemblies, or gave occasion to any tumult in
the synagogues or schools, or disputations of the Jews held either
in the temple or without the temple, or in any other place of the
city.

13. Neither cun they prove, &c. As if he had said, And before
the faces of my accusers I affirm, that they have no plausible argu-
ments, whereby they can demonstrate and evinco, that it is either
probable or likely, that either I stirred up sedition, or brought
strangers into the temple, as they now falsely accuse me before you.
