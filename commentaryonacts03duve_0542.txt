6. And there tlte centurion, fitzdiny (ι skip of Alexandria. That
is, a ship which was come thither from Alexandria, in Egypt.
See what we have said of this city above, ch. vi. 9 ; xviii. 24.

. Sailinq. Straight.

Into Italy. Whither frequently beth victuals and much mer-
ehandise were transported from Egypt in Alexandrian ships.

He put us. From the Adrumetin or Adramytten ship, which
we had gone aboard of 3 above, ver. 2.

Into lter. Which was going straight to Italy, nor was she to

touch anywhere by the way.

7. And when. By reason of contrary winds.

We had sailed slowly many days. That is, when we beheld how
small a space of the sea we had got over in so long a time. “ Nor
was it any wonder,” saith Pricaeus, “that they complained of this,
who compassed the bays, seeing they, who have favourable winds,

reason of many fabIeS, as the arrival of Europa, the loves of Pas-
siphae and Ariadne, the cruelty and fate of the Minotaur, the works
and ssight of Daedalus, and the sepulchre of Jupiter, whereon the
inhabitants showed his name engraven, as Mela, lib. ii., has com-
mitted to memory. Therefore Sallustius, in Servius on that of
Virgil, AEn. viii. ver. 349 :—

Thon did a reverential terror move,
And rustics tremble at the rock and grove.

saith, that the Cretians first found out religion, because that Jupiter
is fabled to have been born among them. It was called by writers
HecatompoliS, because it contained a hundred eines, which Horace
calls towns And therefore Paul left Titus in Crete, that he might
ordain elders, κατὰ πόλιν, in every city, or, as Erasmus renders it,
town by town. According to Ptolemy, lib. iii. cap. 17, it was
bounded on the west by the Gulf of Venice, on the north by the
Cretian sea, on the south by the Lybie, on the east by the Carna-
