the main sea through the Adriatic Sea. Hence Pausanias in his
Arcadios says of the river Alpheus, ‘ N either could Adria stop its
course.’ See more at large there. Moreover the Adriatic Sea-has
its extent even to Africa, if credit may be given to AEthieus and
Orosius, by whose testimony the province of Tripolis, where be
Arzuges and Leptis the Great, has the Adriatic Sea on the north,
and on the south Crete is bounded with the Lybian Sea, which is
also called the Adriatic. Jerome also, in the Life of Hilario, is of
this opinion, where it is said that such as purpose to arrive at
Pachynus in Sicily, from Paraetonium in Egypt, sail through the
midst of the Adriatic Sea. But Procopius, in his Vandalics, lib. i.,
makes most of all for our purpose in asserting that the islands
Malta and Gaul divide the Adriatic and Tuscan sea. The sacred
writer, therefore, wittily and answerably to the constant verdict of
geographers, asserts, that after their being driven from Crete to
Malta, they were tossed in the Adriatic Sea by the violence of the
imminent winds. Moreover, we observed, that the inhabitants of
Malta were styled by the name of barbarians, from a remnant of
Carthaginians that inhabited their fields. Luke makes no mention
of the town of Malta, it being altogether needless. Even so,
Acts xxi. 1, Paul is said to have arrived at the islands Coos and
Rhodes, without the mention of any cities, though in each of
them there were cities of the islands’ name.”

from Africa to Malta, or the inhabitants of Melita, descended of
the Carthaginians. By the ancients, all such as were not Greeks
by birth or language were called barbarians. VVhence Plautus,
according to Festus, called Naevius, the Latin poet, a barbarian.
And in his prologue of his comedy, termed Asinaria, Marcus vortit
Barbams, that is, Plautus rendered it into Latin. And in the
Capteiveis you may read the ‘barbarian law' for the Latin law.
After the sanie manner the Latin authors called all that used not
the Roman tonguc barbarians3 as Cicero, in his Epistles to his
brother QuintUS, denominates the Africans, French, and Spaniards.
Moreover, it is observed by Eustathius on the third Iliad, that the
Lacedemonians called all guests and strangers barbarians. The
Greeks, indeed, and Romans, were wont to give this name to other
nations, because of the harsh and confused sound of their words;
for barbar denotes a mumbling or muttering noise, as «Julius Caesar
Scaliger, a man of an accurate judgment and universal learning,
relates3 or, as the same worthy author conjecturem, they were
