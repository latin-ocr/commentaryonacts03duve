1. While Apollos was at Corinth. VVatering Christianity there,
which was planted by Paul, and diligently promoting the work of
the Lord.

Haviny passed throuyh the upper coasts. That is, Galatia and
Phrygia, Mediterranean countries of the Lesser Asia, and more
northerly situated.

Came to Ephesus. From whence he departed and promised he
