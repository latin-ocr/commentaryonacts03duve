ascend into heaven, and the city of Jerusalem, which they were of
necessity to pass over before they could come to Jerusalem. “As
Bethany,” says De DieU, “is said in the Greek text to have been
near to Jerusalem from almost fifteen furlongs, John xi. 18, the
from signifies the fifteen furlongs lying between, which are of
necessity to be passed over from Bethany to Jerusalem. Thus
Rev. xiv. 20: And tlte blood came 0ch os tlte wine-press unto the
horse-briciles, from tlte space qs* a thousand εἷλ’ hundred furlonys.
The vulgar translation rendering the adverb from, per or by, a
thousand six hundred furlongs3 and that rightly, for from sig-
nifies the adjoining space lying between. Thus, Acts xiv. 24,
They coming] from Perya, the vulgar version translates, They
coming by Perga. Whence it would follow that Christ did not
ascend into heaven from-Mount Olivet, which nevertheless St.
J eroine frequently affirms‚ and which has always hitherto been
believed, as conjectured from Acts i. 12, where however Luke
does not aver it, but from the fields of Bethany, which the gospel
sufficiently declares, Luke xxiv. 50, 51; from which fields of
Bethany the apostles went to Mount Olivet, and took the shortest
way over that hill to Jerusalem.”

Which is a sabbath-days journey. That is, the space between
the city and the foot of the hill, was a sabbath-day’s journey. See
our literal explication upon Matt. xxiv. 20. Says the lately com-
mended De Dieu: “The learned easily reconcile this difference
with J osephus‚ asserting the mountain to be five furlongs distant
from the city. For a sabbath-day's journey consisted of two
thousand cubits, which extent of ground the Hebrews called a
mile, as is manifest out of their writings. But a furlong among
the Greeks contained a hundred paceS, a pace six foot, or four
cubits, as appears from the words of Herodotus,¹ a hundred just
paces are one furlong of six acres, but a pace is the measure of
six foot, or four cubits. One foot contains the breadth of four
hands, and a cubit six hands breadth. Thus far Herodotus. You
see he measures the cubit to be a foot and a half. Therefore six
hundred foot, which made a furlong, amount to four hundred
cubits 3 and, consequently, five fui-longe two thousand cubits. But
how this agrees with the Syrian interpreter, who will have a
sabbath-day's journey to be about seven furlougs, the learned do not
so easily resolve. For our parts we affirm, that the Syrian spake
