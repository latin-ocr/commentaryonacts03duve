critical bye·roads‚ to the most literal of all literal investigations, holding
converse with letters, points, and punctuations t but yet he is sufficiently

meaning of words and phrases, and sufficiently suggestive to indicate the
important truths that are to be found in Scripture phraseology. Occasion—
ally, however, he is somewhat more elaborate than} even the ordinary
expositors ; as sor example, in his geographica] and historica] explanatione
in the second chapter. His learned references, it will be seen, evince a
remarkably extensive acquaintance with writers, both ancient and modern ;
and though we might sometimes spare them, they are usually introduced
in a manner that shows a mind so replete and overflowing with knowledge,
as to prevent the suspicion of their being intended as an ostentatious
display. Subsequent commentators have perhaps in one form or another,
and one after another, given most of the criticisms to be found in this
volume3 but it is to be remenibered that our author led the way, and it
would not be easy to trace them in other writings in such rich and varied
combination.

Among other 'reasons which might be assigned for carefully and critically
studying the Acts of the Apostles, there is one which invests this portion
of the sacred volume with attractive peculiarity. It introduces us into the
interior of the primitive church. We see Christianity in its first elementa
in the primary period of its growth, in the zeal that actuated‚ the love that
united, and the wisdom that guided, under Divine teaching and influence,
the regulations made by its earliest and most endowed disciples. We see
how they gloried in the cross, took joyfully for Christ's sake the spoiling of
their goods, baffled the purposes of their persecutors by an indomitable
courage and death-defying adherence to the gospel, abounded in devotion,
in saith and in charity‚ set their faces as a flint against error, steeled their
hearts against the fascinations of the world, and wore with exultation the
thorny crown which was transferred from their Divine Master to them,—
“ glorying in tribulaffion, that the power of Christ might rest upon them.''
We see in that age of purity and power what may well in this fill us with
shame, and stimulate us to a better course. While led to niourn over our
deficiencies, let us cultivate their piety, and emulate their example. The
grace poured forth upon them, with all its sweetness of spirit and energy
of action, our God is still able and willing to impart to us. Let us pray
for it; for these are times which demand the apostles' principleS, the
martyrs' courage, and the Redeemer’s love.
