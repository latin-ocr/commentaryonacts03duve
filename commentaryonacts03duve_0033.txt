prophet for a niagician, ns appears by the Samaritam Chronicles3
the epitome of which is set forth by Hottinger in his Antimorinian
Exercitations upon the Samaritan Pentateuch.¹ Nor were the
Jews behindhand with the Samaritans. For Aben Ezra, the most
learned of the Hebrews, upon the book of Esther: ⁶ The Cuthaeans,’
saith he, ‘instead of those words of Genesis, In the beffl'nm'ny God
created, have put, In the beginning Asima created, which Asilna
was an idol in the shape of a goat? Benjamin Tudelensis, in his
Itinerary reports, that the Samaritans wanted the three Hebrew
guttural letters, lte, cheth, and airu both which are false, for that
neither are those guttural letters wanting in any of the Samaritan
Pentateuchs. Neither was Asima, but Nergal, the idol of the
Cuthaeans, of whom consisted the greatest number of the
Samaritans,” 2 Kings xvii. 30. Many other such stories the
Jews invented, in hatred of the Samaritans3 as how they wor-
shipped a dove, and were circumcised in veneration of that
creature 3 and that they worshipped the images that were brought
by Jacob out of Assyria, and lay buried behind Shechem, under
a turpentine tree. To this, the learned Pinedo, “I make no
doubt,” saith he, ‘⁶ but that they worshipped the image of a dove,
in regard they were subject to the empire of the Assyrians: for
that the kings of Assyria always bare in their ensigns the figure
of a dove, ever since the reign of Semiramis. To which Jereiniah
alludes, ch. xxv. 38, where, ‘from the face of the anger of the
dove,’ ⁹ is no more than from the face of the anger of the kings of
Assyria3 in regard the kings of Assyria carry the figure of a
dove in their standards, as now the kings of Spain and the
emperor bear the lion and the eagle.” But the Samarites abolished
all worship of idols from the time that Sanballat built them a
temple upon Mount Gerizim, after leave obtained from Alexander
the Great, and made Manasseh, his son-in-law, and brother of
Jaddi, the first high-priest‚ to officiate therein. And whereas
Epiphanius affirms, that the Samarites celebrated the feast of
Pentecost, and the paschal feast in Autumn, so Scaliger asserts it
to be untrue. But this is certain, that when the Jews lived in
prosperity, the Samaritans affirmed themselves to be Jews, de-
