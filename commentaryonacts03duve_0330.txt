They returned ayaz'n to Lystra. Where a little before Paul was
assanlted with stones.

And to Iconium. Whence above, ver. 5, 6, they fied for fear of

22. Confirrniny. Gregory the Great saith excellently, lib. xxxi„
Mor. in J ob xv, “ Behold Paul was overwhelmed with stenes, yet
he is not removed from preaching the truth. He may be killed,
buthe cannot be overcome. He is cast out of the city as dead,
but he is found another day within the city, an unhurt preacher of
the gospel. O how strong is infirmity within this man! O how
conquering his tormentl O how masterly is his patience! By
the repulse he is stirred up to dispute: by strokes he is raised up
to preach the gospel : he is refreshed by his torment to drive away
the wearisomeness of his labour.”

dignity, and having produced him upon the theatre, his name was
proclaimed by a crier, and it was said, “ To whomsoever this seems

approved of the election‚ by lifting up their hands, testified that
the man elected seemed to them a fit man to bear the office of a
magistrate, but they who disapproved it kept in their hand3 which
party soever had the greater number, had the election deereed
accordingly. Hence came that word χειροτονεῖν, and he who
became magistrate by such suffrages was called χειρουτονητὸς.
