who all of them burst their bowels, the story still is extant, 2
Chron. xxv. 12. Papias, who, as Eusebius declares, was a writer
of little worth, audone that seigned trifles from false interpreta-
tion, confounding the Greek word signifying ‘⁶ headlong,” with
another Greek word signifying “ swellen up,’' and thence erecting
his own dreams, relates that the body of J udas was swelled to that
immensity‚ that so much ground as was sufficient to drive a cart

leans had a distinct dialect from those of Jerusalem: as appears

from the history of Christ's passion, where Peter's tongue betrayed
him.

Hakeldama, The field quloofl. Saith the most learned Lightfoot,
as well because it was purchased with the price of blood, as watered
with the blood of the traitor.

20. For it is written. Now Peter alleges the Scripture, which
before, ver. 16, he had said was to be fulfilled3 that is to say,
according to the mystical sense intended by the Holy Ghost: as the
disciples had learned it from the lips of Christ, explaining the
