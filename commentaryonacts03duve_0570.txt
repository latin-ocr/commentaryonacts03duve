Α murderer. That is to say, one guilty of slaughter, or some
other great offence. “ The particular,” says Bochart, ‘⁶ is here put
for the general.²’ By which figure one of the Furies gets the name
of “ Tisiphone,” from τίειν τοὺς φόνους, “punishing murderers.''
And yet she was not thought an avenger of murder alone, but also
of all other offences.

Ven'qeance. Greek, ἠ δίκη, Justice the goddess. Δίκη was the
name the ancients gave the goddess J ustice, says Bocha1·t. Hesiod,
in his Husbandry‚ ver. 254 ι “ Dice is a virgin descended of
Jupiter, famous and venerable in the eyes of the gods inhabiting
heaven.” And whensoever any revile her unjustly, she forthwith
tells her father Jupiter the son of Saturn, the evil thoughts of such
men. OrpheUS, ver. 349, of thesArgonautics, ver. 344: “ Let the
governess Dice with the avenging Furies be witnesses to this oath.''
In Euripides’s Medea, J ason curses Medea, whose hands were
polluted with the slaughter of the children with this imprecation,
ver. 1389: ‘⁶ But may Erinnys the avenger of slain children, and
Dice of slaughter, destroy thee.” Aristotle, or whoever passes by
that name, in the close of the book De Mmdo, speaking of the great
God, observes that he is attended by Dice the avenger of the trans-
gressors of the divine law. In Orpheus's Hymn on Hours, “ Dice
is 0116 of the daughters of Themis and Jupiter the king.’' We are
presented with a curious and exact picture of her by Chrysippus
in Gellius, lib. xiv. cap. 4. She is said to be a virgin, which
betokeneth her being undefiled, and unexorable by the wicked‚
suffering no speoious oration, or prayer, or fiattery, or any such
like thing. Wherefore she is deservedly painted with a grave and
frowning countenance, that she may be a terror to the wicked,
yielding hope and confidence to the just, since such an aspect is
pleasant to the just, and grievous to the unjust. Plutarch in 1115
book of 'the late Divine Vengeance: ‘⁶ If there be any that suffer
not condign punishment for their misdoings in this life, they are
given up to Dice after death to be punished more severely.” In
Aratus's Phoenomena, she is said in the golden age to have lived
familiarly with men3 and also in the silver age, though more sel-
dom 3 but in the brazen age, when they began to eat the working
oxen, she withdrew herself to heaven.

First they began to eat the labouring oxen ;

Then Dice hating the vain race of men,
Went up to heav'n.
