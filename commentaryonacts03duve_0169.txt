two hundred and fifteen years. Which sum of two hundred and
fifteen years may be made up out of the scriptures without any
difficulty. For Abraham went to Canaan when he was seventy-
five years old, Gen. xii. 4. From the time that Abraham went to
Canaan to the hundredth year of his age, in the which he begat
Isaac, Gen. xxi. 5, are twenty-five years. From Isaac's nativity
to that of Jacob, Gen. xxv. 26, sixty years. From Jacob’s
nativity to his going down with his whole family into Egypt,
Gen. xlvii. 9, a hundred and thirty years. All which years added
together make up the sum of two hundred and fifteen years. As
to the other two hundred and fifteen years past in Egypt till their
going out thereof, Bishop Usher describes them thus ε from J acob’s
going down into Egypt until the death of Joseph are seventy-one
years. Thence till the birth of Moses sixty—four. Thence to the
Israelites going forth out of Egypt eighty, Exod. vii. 7. All
which years joined together make up the two hundred and fifteen
years of the sojourning of the Israelites in Egypt.

“ What God said to Abraham, Know (gf α surely tlzat tley seed shall
be α stranyer z'n a land that is not theim, and they will brings them into
bondaye, and oppress them four hundred years, is not to be under-
stood so, as if the people of God were to continue in that most
grievous bondage for the space of four hundred years 3 but because
it is written. In Isaac shall thy seed be called, the four hundred and
five years are computed from the year of Isaac's nativity‚ until the
year of the outgoing out of Egypt. If therefore you subtract
from the four hundred and thirty years the five and twenty which
intervened betwixt the promise and the birth of Isaac, it is no
matter of admiration, if the scripture would express the four
hundred and five years by the even sum of four hundred, seeing it
uses so to denominate time, that that which a little exceeds or
comes short of the sum of the inore perfect number, be not
computed. What therefore he says, They will brz'nq tlzem into
