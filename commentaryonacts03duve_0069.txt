VER. XXIV] Ll'rERALLY EXPLAINED. 49

In the nn'dst of yon. That is, before your eyes. But when he
had wrouqht so many siqns before them, they believed not in him, John
xii. 37.

23. This, &e This ,J esus, by the decree of the Father whom
he in all things voluntarily obeyed, being surrendered into your
power, with an incredible importunity you forced the Romans to
nail him to the cross.

By the determinate eounsel and sorehnowledfse qs God delivered. In
the Greek, “yielded up.” ‘⁶ They are said to be yielded up‚”
saith Grotius, “who are delivered up to their enemies.'' There-
fore Christ by the determinate decree of God was given up into the
power and disposal of his enemies, whose hostile and inhuman rage
God did not predestinate, as the divines do speak‚ but only fore-
knew. “Predestination,'’ saith St. Austin‚¹ “cannot be without
foreknowledge‚ but foreknowledge may be without predestination.
For by predestination God foreknew those things which he was to
act3 but he may foreknow those things which he himself does
not <103 as all manner of sins. For though there are some which
are in such a manner sins, as to be the punishment of sins—
hence it is said, God 'quave them over to a reprobate mind, to (lo
those thz‘nqs which are not convenient, Rom. i. 28—yet there is no
sin in what is attributed to God, but judgment.’' Thus far St.
Austin.

And hy the hands (gf the wz'cked. In the Greek, ‘⁶ of the lawless.”
The Jews called those lawless and sinncrs which are vulgarly
called pagans. But here Peter means the Roman soldiers, who are
called sinners, Matt. xxvi. 453 Mark xiv. 41 ; Luke xxiv. 7. See
l Cor. ix. 15.

Ye slew. He that is the author and abettor of murder is said to
commit the murder.

24. >Whom God hath raised up. Most excellently, St. Austin22
‘⁶ No dead person is the raiser of himself. He could raise himself,
who was not dead though his fiesh were dead. For he raised that
which was dead3 hc who lived in himself raised himself, but was
dead in the flesh that was to be raised. For the Father alone did
not raise the Son, of whom it is said by the apostles‚ for which
God raised him ,· but also the Lord raised himself, that is, his own
body3 therefore said he, Destroy this body, and z'n three days I will
raise it,’' John ii. 19. “But who is so mad,'’ saith the same St.
