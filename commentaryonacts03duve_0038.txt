18 THE Ac'rs OF THE HOLY APOSTLES [CHAP. Ι.

another manner in God, and God is after another manner in man,
after a manner both singular and proper. For God and man is
one person, and one Christ J esus is both. Everywhere as he i's
God, but only in heaven as he is man.’' “Again,” as Leo well
observes‚1 ‘⁶ The ascension of Christ is our advaneement, and
whither the glory of the head is gone before, thither also is the
hope of the body ealled.'’

apparently known, the apostles adored him as the King of glory,
and J udge of the world, and he being adored, as appears out of
Luke xxiv. 52, they return to Jerusalem, rejoieing in their hearts,
as now having attained to understand that wonderful mean by
which the redemption of mankind was procured, and full of ex-
pectation of the deseent of the Holy Ghost from heaven upon
them, now approaehing and at hand.

From the mount called Olivet. That is, from the farther side of
Mount Olivet, to whieh the village of Bethany adjoined, distant
from ‚Jerusalem about fifteen furlongs, John ii. 18. Whereas the
beginning or foot of the mount was distant not above a sabbath
day's journey, or five furlongS, as we find in Josephus.2 Moreover,
lest we should extend the length or latitude of Mount Olivet too
far, the most famous Ludovieus de Dieu gives us this cantion, that
St. John may be understood [as speaking] of the Jewish furlongs,
whereas Josephus is to be understood of the Greeian furlongs.
“ And so,’⁷ saith he “ Bethany, situated in the farther side of this
mountain, will be no farther distant from the foot of the mountain
than the foot of the same mountain from Jerusalem. For since
five Greeian furlongs make seven Jewish furlongs and a half, that
number doubled will make fifteen Jewish, or ten Greeian furlongs,
which make exaetly two Jewish miles, or a double sabbath-day's
journey. In which sense may be taken that of St. Jerome.³
‘⁶ Bethany, a town two miles from AElia‚ upon the side of Mount
Olivet.” Now if Bethany did not join close to Mount Olivet, but
were seated beyond it, as Adi-iehomius will have it, or some
fnrlongs distant from it, as it is in the J ewish map set forth by
the Jews at Amsterdam‚ then the words were to be translated:
“ and they returned by Mount Olivet;'’ and from the mount seems
to denote that the mountain Olivet lay between the fields of
Bethany whither Christ carried his diseiples, being [about] to
