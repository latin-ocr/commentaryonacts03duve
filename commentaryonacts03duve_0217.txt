blessedness in the heavens.

They were baptized. That is, they were dipped in the water,
according to Christ’s command, Mark xvi. 16.

Both men and women. who, viz.³ did profess themselves to
have embraced the Christian religion3 but not infants, who seeing
they do not at all understand the gospel preached, they cannot
consent unto it, that is, they cannot believe. See what we have
said above, ch. ii, 38, 41, and what we shall say below, ver. 37, 38.

suffer himself to be sent in embassy anywhere by his cardinale and
fellow bishops.
