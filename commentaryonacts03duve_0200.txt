I will carry you away farther than Damascus is carried away.” Now
the inhabitants of Damascus, Amos i. 5, 2 Kings xvi. 9, were carried
over into Kir, which Samuel Petit himself doubts not but was in
Babylonia, and he suspects that that city of Babylonia, which by
Ptolemy in the fourth table of Asia is called Chiriphe, had its
name hence : but the prophet does foretell that the Israelites
should be carried farthcr than those of Damascus were, for these
were carried into Babylonia3 but they should be carried farther
than into Babylonia, to wit, into Media. See 2 Kings xvii. 6.

44. Tabernacle, &c. He aggravates the wickedness of the Jews,
because, when they had both the place and manner of divine wor-
ship prescribed by God‚ both in the wilderne'ss and in the promised
land, they hankered after external figures with a preposterous abuse
of the true and pure worship. As if he had said, The tabernacle
indeed was set up by Moses at the command of God, which should

You see that God meets that hc may speak, and indeed, that I
may speak with thee, to wit, Moses, which might be done without
any assembling of the people. Nor was this name given to the
tabernacle from ῦξηΝζῐ, ‘a porch,’ which was the place the people
met in, but from *blf-{th ‘ the most holy place,’ where was the ark,
where God met with Moses and the high priest; whence Exod.
xxv. 22, Ἤᾞὲἧη, and *I will meet tlzee there, to wit, at the ark,
