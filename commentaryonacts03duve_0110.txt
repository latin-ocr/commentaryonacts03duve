removed by Vitellius towards the end of Tiberius’s reign, when
Pilate left Judea3 it may deservedly be questioned, why Annas
here, and Luke iii. 2, is called high priest: to which Casaubon
answcrs, because that Annas had already borne that high dignity.
Scaliger and Bullinger say, that Annas was so called, because he
was next to Caiaphas, and his segan, vicar, or lieutenant—general in
all the sacred ministry. But Baronius says, it was because he was ’
prince of the great Sanhedrim.

‘⁶ Certainly,” says Blondel, a person of inexhausted learning,
“there were among the Jews not only many priests, but many
chief priests, when David had distinguished the posterity of Aaron
into twenty-four families, who were to officiate in the sacred
ministry by turns. Over every one of these families there was a
chief, who is called the head of the paternal house in the Talmud.
The same person was called chief priest in respect of his classis.
Hence it is that they are called chief priests in thc gospel, and
in Jeremiah elders of the priests, Matt. ii. 3 ; xvi. 213 xx, 183 xxi.
19, 23, 253 Mark viii. 31 3 x. 333 Jer. xxix. 1.

‘⁶ Over these twenty-four families were two chiefs, of which the
first was called properly the high priest, and many times singly,
priest. His vicar might indeed have been numbered among the
chief priests at the beginning3 but whether he alone by himself
were at any time called high priest, I much question. Certainly
Bullinger ought to have proved it, before he affirmed that Annas
was called high priest because he was the high priest’s vicar.

“ In scripture this vicar is called the second priest, not the first.
2 Kings xxv. 183 Jer. lii. 24. The Chaldee paraphrast renders it,
segan. Therefore we read in the Talmud,¹ that the segan ancl
high priest officiated according to their lots. Not that they were
choscn by lots, but that they distributed one with another by lots
several of the sacerdotal functions. And a little after, ‘as often
as it happened that the high priest> was suspended from his func-
tion, the segan was ordered to officiate for him.’

“ Out of the 2 Kings xxiii. 4, it seems that it might be gathcred
that there were many second priests, seeing it is said thero in
the plural number, “the priests of the second order;” but the Chal-
dee paraphrast translates in that place, ‘And the segan,' in the
singular, because often the plural number is used for the sin-
gular.
