else by your stubbornness but bring upon yourselves lamentable
overthrow and destruction. This is the meaning of this verse, so
that it is a complaint and sad expostulation, because they know-
ingly and willingly opposed the word of God. For the imperatives
do not so much command them to do those things, as they upbraid
them, as done already, or to be done at all times, and they have
the force of a threatening prophecy. Therefore the Seventy inter-
preters, as also Christ, in his discourse to his apostles, Matt. xiii„
resolve them into verbs of the future tense. In heariny με shall hear,
and not understand ,· also, the beart of this people is made· fat. And
Paul, Acts xx, referreth what is attributed to the doctrine here
to the corrupt affections of the nation, while he saith that the
Jews petulantly rejected grace when offered. Therefore Clemens,
Strom. i., saith rightly, where he explains the saying of Christ,
that seez‘ny they should not see, cmd hearz'ny they should not hear,
Matt. xiii: They are ignorant 3 not that ignorance is wrought in
them by the Lord (for it is not lawful to think so), but a pro-
phetical discourse of that which was to be, and signified that they
would be inadvertent, not heeding those things that were spoken.
For neither does the prophet blind any people, nor does God,
when he causeth blindness in them, do this efficaciously. But
seeing he daily shewed them his will, ancl morcover did many and
that stupendous miracles, yet they despised and made a mock of
them all, God, provoked with their stubbornness, withdrew him-
self from them, and so suffered thern to wander and perish blind-
folded in their darkness, and that by his just judgment. He
therefore upbraids them with this, that the justice of God may be
conspicuous in punishing and casting off the people. But what
befell Isaiah, to wit, that the Jews stopped their ears to his
prophesying, the same Christ foretold would be his own lot, when
he came in the flesh. For Isaiah and the rest of the prophets are
a type of Christ, as to the office of teaching.'’ See our literal
explanation, Matt. xiii. 13, 14.
