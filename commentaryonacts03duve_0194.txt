174 THE AC'rS OF THE HOLY APOSTLES [OHAP. Vll.

they did not signify that they were delivered by this idol, which
they knew to be void of life, and but lately made3 but that they
might not seem idolators, they would be believed to worship the
true God in this idol. Which very thing Aaron had respect to,
Exod. xxxii. 5, when he called the feast dedicated to that oalf, the
feast of J ehovah, as if the worshipping of that calf had been the
worshipping of God. That Mioah also, who had the molten
teraphim, and Jeroboam who made the calves‚ pretended the same,
appears from Judg. xvii. 3, 13; and 1 Kings xii. 28, which yet
was but a vain subterfuge, nor did it aequit them from the crime
of idolatry before God. That the Israelites so understood these
words, “These are thy godS,'⁷ is evinced by these of N eh. xi. 18,
They made themselves α molten calf, and smel, This is thy qod which
broufsht thee out ‹gf' Efflypt, that is, an image or symbol of that only
God, who in very deed performed what he promised to our fathers,
and delivered thee from the Egyptian bondage with a strong hand,
and stretched-out arm.

For this Moses, &c. The people took occasion to ask this of
Aaron, from Moses’ stay on Mount Sina, whence he did not return
till forty days were expired, Exod. xxiv. 18, which things, though
they are plain in holy writ, Exod. xxxii. 1, yet are strained to a
different sense by the Jews. For on the Hebrew words, And [he
people saw tlzat llloses tarrz’ed, ffl'uj‘m, the Talmudists have it ²011&st
‘⁶ Do not read ffl'fflss, tarried, but L’Jffi' 7⁸2, that is, six are come, viz,
hours. For when Moses went up to the mount hc told the
Israelites, I will return at the end of forty days, in the beginning
of the six hours, from which the fortieth day beginneth. When
therefore these forty days were expired, Satan came to trouble the
world, and said unto them, where is Moses your teacher? They
answered that he was gone up into the mount. But saith he, the
six hours are expired wherein he promised to return ; which when
they did not valne, he added, that Moses was dead. But when
they were no more rnoved at that, he showed them the figure of
his coffin3 and then they said to Aaron, As for this Moses, the
man that brought us out of Egypt, we know not what has befallen
him? In Bereschith Babba, sect. 41, the devil is said to have
shown Moses himself hanging between heaven and earth. In
‚Ionathan’s paraphrase, they conjectured, that Moses was con-
sumed in the mountain, whereon fire glistered fron) the face of
