Some add also Barnabas as one of the apostles, from the foregoing
chapter, ver. 13. “ The apostles,’' saith Spanhemius,¹ “had an
equal dignity, and their cure was universal, not of one church only,
but of all, Matt. xxviii. 193 2 Cor, xi. 283 so that apostles are no

Christ.

And they caused yreat joy anto all tlte bretlaren. This tidings of
such numbers of the Gentiles converted caused the faithful much
