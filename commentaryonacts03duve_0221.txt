VER. xxiv] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 201

{f perhaps, in this place does not signify any doubt, but how much
difficulty and labour Simon is to have in entreating against the
punishment of his wicked deed. “ Therefore,” says Calvin, “Peter
does not strike a fear upon Simon that might subvert or overthrow
this confidence of obtaining in his beart, or trouble him3 but
causing unto him an undoubted hope, if he should beg it humbly,
and from his heart, only for the cause of stirring up of ferventness,
putteth him in remembrance that pardon for the heinousness of
his offence was difficult. It is necessary that our faith shine
before us in going to God: even that it may be the mother of
praying.'’

23. In the ¹qall quz'tz‘erness, &c. Gr. εἷς γὰρ χολὴν πικρίας.
The interpreters take εἷς, in, with the accusative case for ἐν, in, with
the ablative, which elsewhere Ι confess is necessary, whether it
may be so here, I doubt 3 for εἰς may contain a Hebraism, as it is,
Isa. i. 31, aad tlte strony slzall be mink,j'or tow, that is, as tow, and

iniquity, than to be in the gall of bitterness, and bond or band of
iniquity. As if he should say, I see thee wholly, how great
soever thou art, to abound with sins, and to be entangled almost
with inextricable vices. In the words of Peter there are two very
elegant metaphors, whereof the first seems to be taken out of
Deut. xxix. 183 xxxii. 323 the other to be taken out of Isa. lviii.
6. See the like phraseS, 2 Tim. ii. 263 Heb. xii. 15.

24. Pray με to the Lorcl for me. Simon did feel that he was
such within as Peter did say. Therefore when he did judge Peter,
and his fellow John, to be signally honoured with grace and love
by our Lord JcSUS, and to be dear unto God, he will use their
prayer as they did use Job’s prayer, who did injure him.

To wit, above, ver. 203 but although one only, Peter, is said to
have spoken, John, notwithstanding, did approve of his words, or
spoke like to them. ‘⁴ Now,” says Calvin, ‘⁶ a question doth arise,
what is to be thought of Simon ’.Ρ The scripture leads us no further
