before he was made known by preaching.

Jesus Christ. That is, Jesus, who is the Messiah or Christ
promised in the law and the prophets, for the redemption and con-
solation of Israel.

21. W hom tlte heaven must receive. These words carry an ambiguous
sense if you look upon the grammatical construction3 and may
signify as well that heaven is received by J esus, as that J esus is
received into heaven. But when you consider the meaning of
the speaker and the context of the words, it is not probable they
should admit of the first exposition. For¹ Peter, speaking of the
Jews, by whose importunity Christ was put to death, dissuades them
from expecting his corporal presence upon earth. Who, as the same
Peter says, 1 Epist. iii. 22, z's 90726 into heaven, aad sits at the rz’9ht
lamed qs* God, and whom the heaven must receive, not as a prison, but
his own most glorious palace and mansion, more befitting his divine
majesty than the earth, Wherein he lived during the time of his
mortality. Now, by heaven is ineant, not that part of the sky
which is visible to our sight, but the third heaven, Paradise, the
seat and habitation of God, that inaccessible light which God
inhabits. For Christ ascended above all the visible heavens,
Ephes. iv. 10, and sits at the right hand of the majesty of God in
the highest altitudes, to prepare a place for us in the house of his
Father, John xiv. 2.

Until tlte times of restz'tate'on. According to the Greek as
Hesychius interprets it, “until the times of a full finishing or
achieving.’‘ Tei-tullian translates it, “until the times of exhi-
bition ;” and thus he cites this place, ‘⁶ Until the times of the exhi-
bition or setting forth of all things, which God spake by the
mouths of his holy prophotS.”¹ In like manner OEcumenius ex-
plains it, “till all things be finished or pcrformed.” Lightfoot
also admirably expresses the sense of this verse in these words: ²
“Jesiis, the heavens both contain and shall contain as to his
person, till all these things be brought to pass or effect. There-
forc do not continue in the error of the generality of our erring
people, to expect his pcrsonal presence upon earth:q Hence, it is
apparent that Peter meant the time that Jesus should abide
in heaven, according to what he with the rest of the apostles had
heard from the angels before, ch. i. 11. Α5 if he had said, Christ
