He came out of the land qf tlte Chaldeans. As if he had said,
he utterly forsook his father’s house, and together with his father,
Sarai and Lot, departed from Ur of the Chaldeans. Stephen will
have Mesopotamia the same with Chaldea. “The Arabians,⁷’
saith Ludovicus de Dieu, “ are still of opinion that Chaldea be-
longs to Mesopotamia.” For the geographer of Nubia, in the
sixth part of the fourth climate, where he dcscribeth Mesopotamia,
saith, “that Bagdad extendeth thither, which is that we now call
Babylon the metropolis of Chaldea3 whose province Benjamin of
Tudela in his Itinerary, concludeth to be Beretz Sinear, in the
land of Shinar, which is, Chaldea.⁷' But although God’s call
commanding Terah, together with Abraham, Sarai, and Lot to
depart from Ur of the Chaldeans, was directed to Abraham, yet
because Terah was father of the family, therefore, Gen. xi. 31,
the business of migration is ascribed to him, not to a son of his
family, as Scaliger¹ hath rightly observed.

And dwelt in Clzarran. “For no long time,'’ saith the most
eloquent of the Jews, Philo, in his Book of Dreams. Augustine,
de Civ. Dei, xvi. says, that Abraham’s departure from Ur of the
Chaldeans, and from Charran, fell out in one and the same year;
which Josephus coufirms, while he writeth, Ant. i. 8: That
Abraham left Chaldea when he was seventy-five years of age.
“hIoses, speaking,'’ saith Heidegger, “of Terah, Abraham, and the
rest that went with them to Charran,” saith, Gen. xi. 31, '2123' ἾΞὫξΞῚ
and they dwelt there. And of Terah, indeed, that when he was
aged two hundred and five years, he there put a period to his last
day. But Moses bath not expressed how long Abraham and the
rest of his companions dwelt there: yet it is probable‚ that he did
not stay long thero, yea, not a whole year, that he might not seem
refractory to the divine call. For what else but sickness and
infirlnity of body could deter Terah from accomplishing the
journey he had undertaken, whom piety towards God caused to
forsake his native country, and his own house? What also but
dutifulness toward his dying father, who on the account of re-
ligion had given himself for a guide and a companion in this
pilgrimage could hinder Abraham, whose ready obedience in obeya
ing the divine call is so much spoken of in the scripture, from
going straight into the land of Canaan? For that Terah, either
taken with the* pleasantness of the place, as Aben Ezra fondly
