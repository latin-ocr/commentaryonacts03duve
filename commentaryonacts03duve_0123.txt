give way to their own passions, whatever thou hadst ordained in
thy eternal wisdom might come to pass 3 that is to say, that thy
Son should be brought to the shameful death of the cross by the
hands of the wicked, for the salvation of mankind. ‘⁶ The wic-ked,⁷’
saith J unius, “execute the will of God, when they least dream
of it: they execute the will of God: nevertheless they are not
exempted from sault.’' For God contributes nothing to the impiety
of the wicked, though he let loose the reins of their malice, and

Greek and Latin, “the Greek word signifies to prelimit, or to
circumscribe, as it were, within a space or circle.” Moreover, it
