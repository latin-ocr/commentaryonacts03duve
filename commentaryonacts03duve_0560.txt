Melita. It was already foretold by Paul, ch. xxvi. 26, that the
place of their escape, after the violence of the storm driving them
thither, in their designed voyage, should be an island which is now
called by its name Melita. There are two islands recorded of this
name, one being attributed to Sclavonia‚ or to Dalmatia, a part of
Sclavenia, and the other to Africa. Pliny makes mention of the
former, lib. iii. cap. 27, (whence he alleges that Callimachus calls
little pretty dogs for women to play withal by the name of Catuli
Melitaei) and saith that it is situate betwixt Com-ola, or Melena, and
sclavonia, but Scylax placeth it near Corzola. The latter lieth
betwixt Sicily and Africa, and that from thence little pretty dogs
are called Melitaei Catelli is asserted by Strabo in his sixth book,
where he says, “ That before Pachynus a promontory of Sicily,
Melita is to be seen, whence little dogs are called Melitaei.” This ex-
pression, CatelliMelitaei‚ ‘⁶ Malta bitlings‚’⁷ became a proverb, applied
to things that men purchase to themselves merely for pleasure,
without respect to any serious matter, as being of no use thereto.
The African Melita far surpassing that of Dalmatia or Sclavonia,
passes now somewhat corruptly under the name of Malta, the habi-
tation of the cross-bearers, called the Knights of St. John, which
Charles the First, King of Spain, vouchsafed thern, after they had
been expelled Rhodes, their former residence‚ by Solyman the Em-
peror of the Turks. It appears by Diodorus Siculus, lib. iv. Bibl.
Hist„ that it was a colony of the Phoenicians. W herefore Bochart,
in his first book of the Phoenician colonies‚ cap. 26, ingeniously
derives its etymology from the Hebrew word ωέη, “ malat‚'' whence
arises umbri, “ melita,” that is to say, “ evasion‚ 1·efuge‚’' in regard
that it was a place of refuge for the Phoenician merchants, as Dio-
dorus doth attest in the places we just now cited, declaring‚ ‘⁶ That
this African isle, Malta, is a colony of the Phoenicians, whose traffic
being propagated even to the western ocean, had this island for a
refuge, since it had a most convenient harbour, and was situate in
the middle of the sea.” This island was also hlelitan, that is, a place
of refuge to Ulysses, if Melita be, as Cluverius endeavours to prove
at large, not dist‘mct from Ogygia, Calypso’s island. Besides, Ovid,
lib. iii. Fast.‚ gives us account that Anna, sister to Dido, that died at
Carthage, being driven thence, withdrew to this island, which long
