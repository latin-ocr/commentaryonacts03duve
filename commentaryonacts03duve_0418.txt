Saronic Gulf, even as the other port Lechea was towards the west,
upon the Chrissean Gulf 3 the distance in the midst betwixt these
two ports is called Isthmus, and is five miles in length. That there
was a church of the Corinthians at Cenchrea, is evident from Rom.
xvi. 1. See what we said above, ver. 1. Apuleius, As. Aur. lib.
10: “ I pass through Cenchrea, in which city a most noble colony
of Corinthians do reside, it is washed with the AEgean and Saronic
sea, where also the port being a most safe harbour for ships, is fre-
quented with many people.''

For lze lzad α vow. That is, he put himself under a vow. ‘⁶ This
vow‚” saith Salmasius, “cannot be meant for a religious vow, be-
cause the devoted hair was to be laid aside at Jerusalem, and to be
put under the sacrifice of the peace-offering, It seems that it was
a civil vow, that either Paul or Aquila took, such as the Jews did
many times like it. ‘I will not shave my hair before I come to
that place,’ which were the pilgrims' vows. So Paul made a vow
to cut his hair when he came to Cenchrea. Of this kind were the
vows or curses which they took upon themselves, not to take meat
nor drink unless they did such a thing. As they who bound them-
selves under a curse neither to eat nor drink until they had killed
Paul, Acts xxiii. 12.” Yet there are many who understand this of
the holy vow of the Nazarites, by which some bound themselves
for a certain time, as others did for ever. For so long as they were
bound by this vow, it was a heinous crime to shave their hair. See
N umb. vi. 5. But whereas there, ver. 18, 19, the N azarite, having
fulfilled this vow, is commanded to shavc the hair of his head at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and to put it in the
fire which is under the sacrificc of the peace-offering, and to offer
sacrifice unto G0d3 this, while the Jews possessed the land of
Canaan, ought to be done at Jerusalem where the tabernacle was
seated. “But,” saith Grotius, “those precepts with others con-
cerning sacrifices, did not oblige them who lived without J eru-
salem.'’ Lastly, others refer this vow not to Paul's shaving of his
head, but to his sailing into Syria. ‘⁶ He sailed into Syria,’' saith
the learned Samuel Petit, “ that he might keep the feast at J eru-
salem, and it was that which St. Paul vowed3 therefore a little
after, he told the Ephesians that he behoved by all means to keep
the approaching feast at Jerusalem. But why must he do that by
all means? It was not for that law of Moses, that obliged all to
celebrate three feasts at Jerusalem. For he tarricd almost two
=years at Corinth, and three whole years at Ephesus, and went not
