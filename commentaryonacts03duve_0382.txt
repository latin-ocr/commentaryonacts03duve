Paulus Juris-Consultus calls him, “Governor of the prison ;''
Ambrose, “The deputy of the prison;'' others, “The jailor.'’
Now, the Greeks think thc jailor spoken of here to have been
Stephanas whom Paul mentions, 1 Cor. i. 16, and xvi. 15, 17 ; but
this is uncertain, because Stephanas, with his house, is called “the
first fruits of Achaia.'' But Achaia is a distinct and separate
region from Macedonia, where the jailor lived, at Philippi, where
he was converted to Christ: unless one should say that he was
born in Achaia and removed to Philippi, whence perhaps he
returned back again to Achaia, to wit, to Corinth.

24. lVlzo. To wit, the jailor.

lerust chem into tlte inner prison. That, to wit, being inclosed
within so many gates, they might be the more securcly kept.

Made theirfeet fast. The word in the original is, “ He guarded
their feet,’' that is, made them secure. “ By a lnetonymy,” as
Grotius saith, “for a guard secures us.”

In tlzewood. That is (as it is interpreted in the English transla-
tion) in the “ stockS,” which Plautus calls a ‘⁶ lVooden guard.''

25. And at mislqulzt. When men are, as it were, buried in deep
sleep.

Sanfs praises vento God. Ruffinus, presbyter of Aquilia, in the
title of the 7 2nd Psahn, saith, ‘⁶ Hymns, are songs which contain
the praise of God. If it be praise, and not of God, it is not a
hymn3 if it be praise, and of God, if it be not sung, it is not a
hymn. It must, therefore, that it may be a hymn, have these
three things, praise, and of God, and a song.” And therefore
deservedly doth Gregorius Breticus,¹ bishop of the city Granada in
· Spain, call David “Hymnidicus.'’ Paul, then, and Silas, sung
praises to God for the honour put upon them, in that they suffered
innocently, for promoting the glory of God. See above, ch. v. 41.

26. And suddenly there was a yreat eartlzquake. By the great
power and might of God.

So that thefozcndatz'07zs of tlte prison were slmhen. Not only did
the edifice of the prison itself totter, but also the very ground
upon which it was built was greatly shaken. By such an earth·
quake God shows that he himself is present with his servants, and
that by his strength they shall bc rcscued from the severity of
furious magistrates.

And immediately. That is, as soon as by the carthqualke the
whole prison was shaken.
