and minds among themselves, and cohabit together without strife
or contention, but also acted and desired the same thing, chiefly in
matters of religion, and more particularly in the duty of prayer.

In prayer. According to the Greek, “in prayer and supplica-
tion.'' This St. Luke in his Gospel, ch. xxiv. 53, expresses in
these words, praz'sz'nq ancl blessinq God. Thus St. Paul makes prayer,
blessing, and giving thanks, to be all one, 1 Cor. xiv. 4, ἕζεο. Thus
supplication seems also to be taken for giving thanks, Phil. i. 4.
N evertheless, sometimes supplication is distinguished from prayer,
and then it is taken for deprecation, or prayer to remove or repel
some evil. Hence J unius upon this place: “ The disciples,” saith
he, “ besought as well the sending of the Holy Ghost, as to

delivered out of the hand of his cnemies, and out of the hand of
Saul, as being the most potent of his adversaries. And in the
Hebrew bibles, reelzes, a most excellent sort of horses, is particu-

Peter standiny up. To whom the priority of degree was given,
in regard of his seniority, according to St. Jerome, Cassian, and
several others of the fathers. -μ

The number of men. Some ancient Latin exemplars, together with
the Greek, read names, as it is in the English version. But by
