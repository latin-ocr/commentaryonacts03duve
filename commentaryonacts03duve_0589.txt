new colours, but shows the difference, which in the darkness was
none at all.” Therefore, the Gospel, which enjoins the most
perfect love amongst all men, does turn the hearts of believers to
peace and concord, but the incredulity of them who follow the
dictates of the flesh, and have no relish of true godliness, and of
