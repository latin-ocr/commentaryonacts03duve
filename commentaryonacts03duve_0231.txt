vER. xxxvi] mrERALLY EXPLAINED. 211

Oflzimself. These things in some manner in a typical sense
may not badly be understood of Isaiah himself, who suffered many
evils in Manasses’s time. But they are understood of another in
a full and perfect sense, to wit, of Christ, that suffered griefs,
reproaches, and a bitter death, that he might give us eternal
salvation.

35. And openiny, διο. As if he should say, But Philip having
begun along oration from this place of Isaiah, which was before
his hands, he took an occasion to instruct the Eunuch about J esus,
in whom this and other predictions of the prophets are fulfilled in
an excellent manner. He told him that that J esus who was born
of the family of David, born of a virgin at Bethlehem, and
suffered a bitter death for our offences, was raised from the dead,
to sit at the right hand of God the Father, whose only begotten
Son he is, and that none is to obtain eternal salvation, but those
who, earnestly repenting of their sinful condition, believe in J esus
himself, and obey his preceptS. And that those that do profess
his saith and repentance, ought to be dipped into the water accord-
ing to Christ’s appointment, that the remission of sins may be
sealed unto thern by this holy dipping, which remissiori is freely
granted to every repenting sinner, when he does believe in Christ.

36. And as they went on their way. That is, while they went
forward in the Eunuch’s journey to Gaza from Jerusalem.

They came unco α certain water. Eusebius, in his book of Hebrew
placeS, which J erome did translate and augment, saith, “Bethsur is
in the tribe of Judah, or Benjamin, and at this day is called Beth-
soron, a village to us in the twentieth mile, as we travel from
AElia to Hebron, near which there is a fountain that springeth at
the foot of the hill, and is sucked up by the same ground in which
it ariseth. And the Acts of the Apostles do tell us that the
Eunuoh of Candace the queen was baptized in this fountain by
Philip. And there is also another village called Bethsur, in the
tribe of Judah, distant a thousand paces from Eleutheropolis.'’

See, here z‘s water, &cn It doth manifestly appear that the eunuch
among other things was taught by Philip, that baptism in water
was of necessity to be taken by them, who, repent-,ing of their sinful
life, do embrace the faith of Christ, as a holy rite appointed and
commanded by Christ himself, that it might be in itself a figure
of new life, and a seal of the remission of sins obtained through
Christ.
