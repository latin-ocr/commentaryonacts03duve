to Jerusalem to keep the feast. What therefore Paul saith in this
place, that he was put to it of necessity to go to Jerusalem to the
feast, he was put to it by his vow, not that he was now any more
bound by the Mosaical law. But one may ask, why in the history
of Paul's going to Jerusalem, are these words inserted, and having
shorn his head at Cenchrea, and what was the reason why Paul did
shave his head? We will easily give the reason, God willing3 it
is therefore to be noted what was Paul's custom among the eom-
mon people, to wit, he became a J ew to the J eWS‚ as under the
law to these who were under the law, 1 Cor. ix. 20. From this
usual custom we doubt not but Paul, so long as he was among the
Corinthians, did make much of his hair, for among the Greeks this
was a sign of a free-born man, as appears by the verse of Aristo-
phanes which went into a proverb:

¹‘Besides‚ indeed, thou being a servant bath hair.
Forasmuch as it belongeth to free persons to let grow their hair,’'

as the ancient masters observe3 but that the Jews had a contrary
custom, not to cherish their hair, but to shave it to the quick,
appears from the Nazarites, who for the religion of their vow,
abstained thirty days from shaving their hair, therefore they who
were liable by no religion of a vow to cherish their hair, they
cherished it not, but were shaved again and again, or perhaps
oftener‚ every month. Seeing therefore Paul, who let his hair
grow according to the custom of the Corinthians, was going from
Corinth to Terusalem, before he would loose from the port, laid by
his hair, and shaved his head to the quick, after the manner of the
Jews. For he doubted not to have to do with them at Jerusalem,
therefore he who resembled the Corinthians, so long as he was at
Corinth, would also resemble the Jews, coming to Jerusalem their
metropolis.''

Priscilla being gone from Corinth came to Ephesus, the metropolis
of the province which is most strictly called Asia. See what we
