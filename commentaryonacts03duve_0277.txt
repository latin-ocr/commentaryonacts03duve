from the. Hebrews, by whom they are said to take, or accept a
man’s countenance} or to look upon a man’s countenance, who, for
some quality they see or know in him, as for his power, riches,
nobility, kinship, do so reverence and love him, that for his sake
they deviate from truth, justice, and right. Hence is that reviling
of the judgeS, Psa. lxxxii. 2: How lony will με judye my'ustly, and
accept tlte persons qf the wicked? Hence the Pharisees and the
Herodians, deceitfully endeavouring to entrap Christ, said, (Matr.
xii. 163 Mark xii. 14,) We lmow that thou ressardest 77οϊ the
persons of men, but teaelzest the way qs God ’ἱη ἰνῑιΐΙι. For this
reason justice is painted blind, because it respects not the faces of
men. But because the Greek word πρόσωπον, the compound of
which, προσωποληψῖα, ‘respecting of persons,⁷ signifies both the
face and person, from thence it happens that the Latin inter-
preters sometimes translate it, ‘to respect the face,” sometimes, ⁶ to
respect the person,’ when as the Hebrew word ΠῗὶΞ) properly does
only signify ‘faces’ WVhence also the Syriae translates it, ‘the
respecting of faces‚‘ here, and James ii.⁷’ Thus far Estius.

foreigners should follow the legal rites of the people of Israel, to
obtain grace with God. That was only requisite to make them be
partakers of the land of Canaan and its temporal blessings. But
as to the spirituals, it was always true, which Peter here saith, In
all nativus, lze tltatjhareth God and worketll rv'ylzteousness is accepted
with him ; although through prejudice he had not understood this
before. For he speaks of the uncircumcised Gentiles, who did not
keep the law of Moses, such as was Cornelius the centurion. For
this reason the prophets, when they reprehend the wickedncss of
idolatrous people, and denounce the judgments of God against
them, they never accuse them for omitting circumcision, or keeping
of the sabbath, or violating any such like ceremonies, neither do
they advise them to keep them: but only remember their sins
against the law of nature. For that covenant did oblige no others
besides the Israelites, with whom it was made. Of this, see Isaiah,
from ch. xiii. to ch. xxii„ and Ezek. from ch. xxv. to ch. xxxiii.
Also Obadiab, Jonah, and Nahum. And m01eover, when other
people wele called by the Gospel to the knowledge of the true
God, God would not oppress them with the burden of the celemo-
mal law as after, ch. xv.

He that searetlz him. That is, who sears nothing more than that
