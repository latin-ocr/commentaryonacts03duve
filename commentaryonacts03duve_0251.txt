were blasted, with the brightness of that light sent to him from
heaven. ,

He heard α voice. To wit, descend from heaven with that light.

Sayz'ny. To wit, in a Hebrew dialect, as Paul himself saith
below, ch. xxvi. 14.

Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me ‚P Augustine saith elegantly,
as his manner is:¹ “The Head being to ascend into heaven, he
commended his members upon earth, and departed. Now you do
not find Christ speaking upon earth. You find him speaking but
in heaven, and from heaven itself. Why? Because his members
were trod upon on earth. Therefore he said from above to Saul
the persecutor, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? I ascended
into heaven, nevertheless Ι lie upon earth, as yet. I sit here at
the right hand of the Father3 there I am hungry, thirsty, and a
stranger, as yet.” Believers are the mystical body of Christ, and
his mystical members3 hence whatever is done to them, Christ
takes it as done to himself. See Matt. xxv. 40, 453 Luke x. 16.

5. Wlw art thou, Lord ? As much as to say, WVhose voice do I
hear?

And tlte Lord said. As much as to say, Christ, who was in
heaven, and spake from heaven itself, answered.

I am Jeszcs, &a As much as to say, You hear the voice of that
J esus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest, while you pour out
your rage and storms of your wrath upon my servants.

It is hard. That is, it is a very troublesome and vain labour.
“ If thou beatest the pricks with thy fists, thou hurtest thy hands,”
says Plautus.²

To kz’ck afsaz'ast the pricks. The Greek and Roman writers fre-
quently use this proverb against such as attempt a thing that will
happen ill to them. For if oxen being thrust and galled with the
goad, while they draw the plough or cart, should kick, while they
would hurt the goad, they do but hurt themselves, because as the
scholiast upon Pindarus, in the end of his second Pythia, saith,
“They are more sorely stricken,” and beating their heel against the
sharp goad, they are pricked again with its point. Therefore, by
this proverbial phrase the Lord J esus declares that Saul⁷s wrestling
against him was to his own great hurt, so that if he desisted not
from applying himself to ruin the Christians, it would come to pass

that he should die a sad death.
