Malta. ‘⁶ Thosc men,” says Bochart, “ were accounted barbarians,
because the most of them who inhabited the island of Malta, were
neither Greeks nor Romans, but Phoenician or Carthaginian in-
habitants, as is proved elsewhere by the testimonies of Scylax,
Diodorus, and Stephanus.'’ Wherefore‚ if credit may be given
Orosius in his fourth book, cap. 8: “ Atilius the Roman consul,
in his sea-expedition against the Carthaginians in time of the first
Punic war, passing through Sipara and Malta, noble islands of
Sicily, quite overthrew them. And at the second Punic war,
T. Sempronius sailed over from Lilibaeum now called lNIazara, into
the island Malta, possessed by the Carthaginians. As soon as he
arrived, Amilcar the son of Giscon, governor of the garrison,
together with two thousand soldiers, or thereabouts, and the town
of the island were surrendered to him.” Thus Livy, in his first
book of the third Decade: “Resides, we observed already that
Melita is a Carthaginian name. It remains then that the inhabit-
ants of Malta, as also the other African Carthaginians, were a part
of the barbarians, from whom the country itself was at length
named Barbary.⁷'

lee venomous beasz‘ huny on leis hand. On which, to wit, she had
fastened. Bochart says that “ &npi'ov denotes not only a beast in
general, but also a serpent, or venomous beast. Ecclesiast. xii. 17,
“ Who should show pity to an enchanter bitten by a serpent, or
any such as approach to beasts?” understand mammons, that is,
vipers, or serpents. Dioscorides, lib. i. c. de Vince, or pal-k-leaves,
τὰ φύλλα ἑποὲῐυμιώμευά τε καὶ ὑποστρωυύμευα θηρία διώκει, Which
Pliny renders thus, lib. xxiv. cap. 9: The leaves once perfumed
or strowed drive away venomous beasts. Hence in the Books
of Physicians, θεριόδηγμα and ἓηριόδηκτος are every where
spoken of one bitten by a serpent, and θηρίακα φάρμακα, are
such medicines as cure men of serpents' venoni. ln this sense
Josephus, in the second book and fifth chapter of his Antiqusties,
calleth Ethiopia ἓνηριοτρόφος, because it brings forth many ser-
pentS. And the Marsi that seed on serpents, are by Galen styled
θηρίοτροφοι μαρσοῖ. Likewise Dionysius I-lalicarnassus calls the
Greek σῖγμα, θηριώδης, ‘a serpentine letter,’ because it resembles
serpents hissing. Mox-cover the word rrrr importing any wild beasf,
to the Hebrews, is a serpent in thc Arabio language. Neither
observe the Chaldecs much diffcrcnce in the words &rw and wir-r,
the former signifying a beast in general, and the latter a serpent.
So that Luke’s τὸ θηρίου is a serpent, and consequently a viper.’'
