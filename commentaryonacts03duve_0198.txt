they are said to have had no wine nor strong drink, that is, inebriating
liquor, all the forty years they were in the wilderness. Therefore,
whereas in the Greek version, Exod. xxxii. 18, Moses, coming
down from the mount, saith to his servant Joshua‚ φωνὴν ἐξαρχόυ-
των οἴνου ἐγὼ ἀκούω, ‘I hear the voice of them that are singing
through wine‚’ that οἴνου, whencesoever it has crept in, is a mere
gloss, of which neither the Hebrew text nor other versions have
the least appearance of. For in the Hebrew it is only Πίσῃ-ζ ὂψ, ‘ I
hear the voice of them that sing? or, that sing one after another.
I think therefore that some of the Greeks have rendered it, φωνὴν
ἐξαρχόυτωυ, others, φωνὴν ὀυοὺθ, for whichfthe half-learned have
written οἴνου, and thus made up of both, φωνὴν ἐξαρχόντων οἴνου.
So that the ὀυοὺθ might be instead of the Hebrew nm), as it might
be read before the vowels were written down, and be written by
them who were ignorant of the force of the Hebraism. For it was
not unusual with them merely to copy words that were unknown
to them. The Samaritan renders it ‘ the voice of sinners,' as also
the Syriae, for instead of nini] they read it nim-3. Truly therefore
the Greek scholiast‚ the Samaritan, <1 hear the voice of sins!

43. Yea, με took up. &c. That which is here declared, that the
Israelites carried about with them in waggons and litters the images
of Moloch or Remphan, was done by them when they yet abode
in the wssdemess, to wit, when they, enticed by the wiles of the
Moabitish and Midianitish women, worshipped Baalpeor, or Bel-
phegor, the god of the Moabites, and as I think, of the Midianites
also, and offered sacrifices to it, Num. xxv. 3 Ps. cvi. For Baal and
Moloch, or Melech, or Molech, are names common to all the gods,
which were distinguished and differenced by epithets, as you may see
by comparing 2 Kings xviii, 34, and Isa.xxxvi. 19, with Isa. xxxvii.
