doth appear.” This custom being brought in, was much more
frequent in Africa than in Asia and other parts of the world, and
with a certain greater opinion of necessity, unto which they did
fall, who did expound of baptism, that of Christ, John iii. 5:
Except α man be born of water ami of tlte Spirit, lte cannot enter into
tlze kingdom of God, δια, as if it did also include infants 3 whereas,
notwithstanding, our Lord J esus speaketh unto those only that
were come to age, in the person of N icodemus, and doth declarc
how greatly they stand in need to be born again of the Spirit and
of water: that is, of the Spirit purifying their heartS. Christ,
indeed, by this metaphor, alludeth unto the baptism of water that
was sometime to be commanded by him, but did think only of the
baptism of persons grown to years of understanding, seeing he
commanded, Matt. xxviii. 19, that those that were to be baptized,
should first be instructed in the saith. ‘⁶ For it cannot be that the
body receive the sacrament of baptism, except the soul receive the
verity of faith beforehand,'’ as Jerome hath observed on that place
of Matthew. See what we have noted above, upon ch. ii. 41,

W 2·th all thy lzeart. That is, With an earnest desire of thy heart,
and an unfeigned faith. “ The scripture,” says Calvin, “ostentimes
taketh the whole heart, for the sincere, and unfeigned heart, unto ⁸
which is opposed a double heart. So there is no need that we
should imagine them to believe perfectly, who believe with their
whole heart, when there may be a weak and small faith in him,
who notwithstanding shall have an upright heart, and free from
dissimulation. So it is fit to take that which David glorieth of,
that he doth love the Lord with all his heart. Philip truly did
first baptize the Samaritans, whom as yet he knew to be far
distant from the mark. The saith, therefore, of the whole heart,
is that, which having lively roots in the heart, nevertheless endea-
voureth to grow daily.’'

Thou mayest. Hence we may gather how absurd their opinion
is, who think that by baptism, saith is produced in infants new
born, and destitute of the use of all reason. For if baptism cannot
do it in those that are come to years, it can much less do itin
infants. Neither can it be said, except very absurdly, that they
do believe in Christ, or in his gospel, when there does not indeed
appear even the least shadow of saith in them. They do not
know their parents by any token, and know not what dif-
ference there is betwixt their right and left hand, how then are
