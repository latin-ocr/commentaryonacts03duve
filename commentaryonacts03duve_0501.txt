signified 10 Felix that they would prove Paul guilty.

2. And when Paul was ealled. To judgment by a herald or

Tertullus heyam to accuse him. That is to say, Tertullus accused
Paul most grievously. In holy writ, often he is 'said to begin to do
a thing who already does it.

Seez‘ny tlzczt by thee we elgjoy [frent quz'etness, As if 116 had said,
With a full aclmowledgment of thy worthy (leeds to us-ward at
every time and in every place, we profess, that by your un-
paralleled vigilance and wisdom, the robberies that used to be
committed in Judea are quelled, the murders are repressed in
many placeS, and peace is settled through all the province which
you are set over. Felix indeed did overthrow Eleazar, that famous
robber, and that Egyptian impostor, mentioned above, ch. xxi. 8,
together with their forces, to the unspeakable advantage of the
JeWS, as ,Iosephus declares31 but otherwise he governed Judaea
with covetousness and cruelty. He caused the high priest Jona-
than, son to Annas, to be murdered by assassins, because he used
frankly 10 reprove him when he did amiss3 he also suffered them
to commit several insolencies upon the Jews without punishment,
as the same ,Iosephus testifies in the place but now cited. And so
the mercenary Tertullus seeks to get the favour of Felix by an
intolerable flattering.

IlIcmy tlzz'uys ure amended. In the Greek is added, as also 111 1116

rageous wickednesses and corruptiOnS, which had crept into this

nation, are by thee amended and rectified with great, vigour and
happiness.

3. We accept. That is, we ackuowledge.
