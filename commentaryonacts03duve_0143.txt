those are placed. And so much against Casaubon's opinion,¹ who
thought that Theudas, of whom mention is made in the Acts, to
have been older than J udas. But one will perhaps say, that from
what we have argued, it seems to be abundantly evinced that
Theudas was not older than J udas of Galilee3 yet nevertheless
that Theudas, whereof Luke speaks, must be distinguished from
that Theudas mentioned by Josephus, 20th book of his Antiq„
toward the end of ch. 2.; for the first Theudas, of whom Gamaliel
speaks in that oration which he had in the J ewish council, did
raise a tumult in Judea about the time of Christ’s passion. But
the other, of whom Josephus speakS, stirred up sedition after the
death of King Agrippa, while Cuspius Fadus governed Judea,
about the fourth year of the reign of Claudius Augustus. Seeing,
then, that Gamaliel had this speech a little after Christ's resur-
rection, and before Stephen’s martyrdom, that is, about the latter
end of Tiberius’s reign, he could not at all have spoken then of
that commotion which Theudas made while Claudius reigned.
We cannot meet this objection any other way, unless we say that
‚losephus was mistaken in making Theudas's sedition later than
he ought. For that there were two Theudases, who feigned
themselves prophets, 0115 aster another, stirring up the Jews to
hope for new things, I can no ways be persuaded. Let Luke and
Josephus be compared, where both of them speak of Theudas, and
it will plainly appear that they both meant one and the same man.
Certainly all circumstances agree so exaetly in both narratives,
that ‚Josephus seems to have comlnented upon Luke. One differ-
ence there is as to the time, which yet is not of such moment that
we should invent two Theudases3 for if as often as we meet with
such differences in the narratives of ancient writers, we would
distinguish persons and things, we must beware, lest unadvisedly
we make two men of one. How much more sase is it, when we
find two writers differing among themselves, to say that one of
them is in a mistake, which since it is wicked to affirm of the
scripture, the whole blame must be laid upon Josephus.” Light-
foot saitl],2 “Admit only that Josephus errs in eomputing the
times, and the whole difficulty is removed. And truly, I 555 not
upon what account we owe that reverence and modesty to
«Iosephus, as to wrestle so much for his reputation. Another
Theudas must be found out, or the pointing of commas altered,
