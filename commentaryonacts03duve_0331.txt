Elders. Famous Frederick Spanhemius in his Isagogick Epitome
to the History of the New Testament: “The bishops,” saith he,
“ which were ordained in every church, were so called from the
care, τῆς επισκοπῆς, of overseeiny, as the same are called πρεςβύ-
τεροι, elders, from their age and gravity, ποιμένες, pastors, from
their office of feeding, διδάσκαλοι, διάκονοι τοῦ λόγου, doctors,
ministers, from their »office of teaching and ministering to Christ,
προστάται, ἡγούμενοι, set over, yover720r3, from their right to govern.’⁷
Compare below, ch. xv. 2, 4, 6, xx. 17, 283 Tit. i. 5, 7 3 1 Thess.
v. 12. Irenaeus in his Epistle to Victor, bishop of Rome, in
Eusebius, lib. v., Hist. Ech, ch. 26: ‘⁶ The elders, who before
Soter governed the church that you now govern, were, Ι say,
Anicetus, Pius, Hyginus, Telespore, sixtus? Irenaeus everywhere
calls them elclers whom others do frequently call bishops, ancl to
whom he attributes the government of the church of Rome. Also
Victor himself in an epistle under his name to an unknown Desi-
derius, bishop of Vienne in France‚ expresseth himself thus, ‘⁶ As

apostles in the fiesh, and who governed the church until thy time.”

25. And when they hadpreached the word in Perya. As much as

to say, and when they had preached Christ's gospel in Perga, of

They went down into Attalia. The city Attalia having its name
from Attalus Philadelphus, its builder, is by Strabo mentioned
among the cities of Pamphylia, Geog. lib. 14.

26. And thence sailed to Antioeh. The metropolis of Syria.

Whence they had been recommended to the yrace of God, &c. AS
much as to say, Whence having gone forth to preach the gospel,
they were recommended to God by the prayers of the church, that
he would put forth his grace to advance the labours of the apostle

of the Gentiles, whom himself had appointed. See above, ch.
xiii. 3.
