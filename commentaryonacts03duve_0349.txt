vna. xx] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 329

Acts xv„ the words of the apostle's decree, and afterwards out of
the twenty-first chapter, those which there J ames repeats, but still
omitting the mention ‘ of [things] strangled 3⁹ which that he did not
by inadvertency is plain by these words which he adds: ‘We see here
that the apostles would impose no burthens of the old law, as far
as it relates to corpor-al abstinence, on the believing Gentiles, but
only these three things, viz., that they should abstain from what
had been offered to idols, and from blood, and from whoredom.
WVhence some think that there are only three deadly sins, idolatry,
murder, and fornication, in which last is understood adultery, and
all other fleshly mixtures but with a lawful wife) The seventh
witness shall be Pacianus, bishop of Barcelona, who Bellarmine
says died whilst Theodosius was emperor. He, in his Exhortation to
Repentance, speaks thus, ‘It seems good to the Holy Ghost, and
to us, to lay no further weight upon yon, but this: it is necessary
that you keepy ourselves from things sacrificed to idols, and blood,
and from fornication, from which abstaining you shall do well;
farewell: this is the whole conclusion of the New Testament.' In
which words there is no mention of ‘ [things] strangled.' The last
evidence shall be Gaudentius, bishop of Brixia, in his Treatise of the
Maccabees, who mentions indeed thiu-qs stranyled, but not as any-
thing distinct from blood, but comprehends them therein. “There-
fore (saith he) St. JameS, with the rest of the apostles, made a
decree to be observed in the churches, to abstain from things
sacrificed, from fornicati0n‚ and from blood, that is, from thinys
stranqled. They passed by homicide, adultery, witchcrafts, be-
cause those things needed not to be named in the churches, which
even by the laws of the Gentiles were punished. They preter-
mitted also all those minuter legal observations, and established
only the things before-mentioned to be observed, viz„ that we
should not be profaned with unclean meats sacrificed to the devil,
nor yet be polluted by the blood of animals strangled, nor violate
our bodies, which are the temples of God, by the uncleanness of
whoredoms.’

‘⁶ All which testimonies manifestly show, that this parti0ular, of
thinys strare-qlod, was not anciently in most copies of the New
Testament, or was comprehended in the prohibition of blood, and
consequently, that there is some ground to suspect the same to
have been falsified. For which there is this reason of no small
moment to be added, that the eating of things strangled, or (which
is tantamount) of that which dieth of itself, is by the law of Moses
