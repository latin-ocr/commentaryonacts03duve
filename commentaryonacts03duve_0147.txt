another who should make a more just taxing. Further, how could
that former taxing be made by a Roman magistrate, while Herod
reigned, seeing that the senate had deelared Herod to be king of
Judea by an undoubted right 3 neither had the Roman magistrate a
right to act anything by authority in Judea, so long as king Herod
lived. I pass by, thatin the last days of Herod, wherein Christ
was born, Saturninus and Varus, but not Quirinius, were Caesar’s
deputies in Syria. These be the arguments whereby I am chiefly
inclined to think Scaliger³s opinion not probable, who argues for
two taxings. Neither deth it withstand that Luke saith, that the
taxing which was made a little before Christ was born was the
first, for by it is only meant that this was the first time wherein
the Romans taxed Judea, neither was there ever any taxing
before. It is also false what Scaliger saith, that the latter taxing
belonged to Archelaus²s teirarchy, and was for his goods only.
Yea, J osephus saith expresslyl that Quirinius was sent- by Caesar
to tax throughout Syria and Judea. Petavius followed Scaliger⁷s
opinion,2 to which he adds this only, that both these taxings were
made by Quirinius, being sent with an extraordinary power to
Syria. But both Luke and «Iosephus, their words refel this, for
Luke saith, When Cyrenizcs was fsovernor qs* Syria, and Josephus
bath: ‘To do justice among the peopleg’ which cannot be said
but of the ordinary governor. Casa-ubon, in his Exercitations,
takes the same course to reconcile J osephus and Luke. But indeed
in my judgment all of them have lost their labour, for one of
them must needs be in a mistake, which, since it is heincus to say
of the evangelist, it is safer to lay the cause of the mistake upon
the Jewish writer. Which, if it seem somewhat harsh to any,
there remains yet this one way of reconciling them, which we
mentioned already, that in Luke's text we restore Saturninus
instead of Quirinius, and that we say the taxing in his time was
made, not by the Roman governor, but by King Herod himself.
It might also be said that this taxing was indeed finished and
perfeeted, when Quirinius was governor after Archelaus⁹s banish-
ment3 yet it began long before, towards the end of Herod’s
reign, at which time Christ was born. Thus also the difference
that appears between Luke and Josephus is taken away. By this
means Luke and ,Iosephus agree excellently well together, for the
evangelist calls that taxing which began to be made about the
