558 THE Acrs or THE Hom APos'rLEs [CHAP. xxvn

We set sall. [Latin, vzccvzyavitrzzcs.] That is, we were carried
forth. „

In a skip of Alexandria. As also before we were carried from
Lycia in a ship of Alexandria bound for Rome3 above, ch. xxvii. 6.

leose sigjn was Castor. That is, Castor and Pollux, who are
called Διόσκουροι, that is, Jupiter’s sons by Leda, daughter of
Thestius, wife to Tyndarus king of Laconia3 both have the name
of Castor from one of them. Whence Pliny, lib. x. cap. 43, “Above
the temple of the Castors.’' Arnobius, lib. v.; against the Gentiles,
“The Castors, sons of Tyndarus3 one used to tame horses, the
other was a good champion,’' &c. hlinntius Felix: “ Castor and
Pollux die by courses, that they may live.'' They, when first they
grew to men⁷s years, sconred the seas of pirates, and for that reason
were accounted gods of the sca, whom marine'rs used to invocate
in storms. Afterward they went into Colchis with the Argonautae3
in which expedition Pollux killed Amymus, king of the Bebrycians,
who laid an ambush against him. Then returning home they took
back their sister Helena, who was ravished by Theseus, when they
had stormed the city of Aphydna in the absence of Theseus. At
length, when Castor died, they say that Pollux, who having been
born of the same egg with Helena was immortal, out of love to
his brother, begged of Jupiter that he might share his immortality
with his brother, which having obtained, they are said to die
alternatively and live again. Which fiction arises from hence,
because as Servius saith on AEn. vi, the constellation Gemini, that
is assigned to them, is so, that when one star of it setteth the other
riseth. Yet Macrobius, Saturnal, lib. i. cap. 21, as he referreth all the
other gods, so them also to the sun, when he saith, “But the
Gemini, who are supposed to die and live by cotirseS, what else do
they signify but one and the same sun, now descending into the
lower hemisphere, anon mounting to the highest altitude of this ?’'
‘⁶ Moreover, the Castors, or Castor and Pollux, were usually
painted, like handsome young men, most decently apparelled, and
sitting on horseback,⁷’ saith the famous Lightfoot. And they ap-
peared thus equipped, if you'll believe the relator, in the engage-
ment at the lake Regillus, leading on the Roman cavalry, and
defeating the enemy, so that the victory was obtained by their
conduct.’' (Dionys. lib. vi. Rom. Antiq.) Yet sometimes they are
drawn on foot. But that the ships of Alexandria used to have the
effigies of Castor and Pollux on their snout, that notable place of
Cyril indicates, which the most renowned Heinsius citeth out of
