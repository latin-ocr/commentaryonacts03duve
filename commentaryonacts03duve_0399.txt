and the Stoies, unprofitable hearers of gospel grace3 for that they
make their own wise man equal with the gods, and place man’s
chief good in his own strength. The rest of the multitude, in
miserable blindness, worshipped all kinds of demens for the true
God. How doth 116 temper his speech at such a theatre‘? Does
he begin to execrate their crime of idolatry? Does 116 call the
gods of the Athenians‚ wood or stone, or which is worse than
these, wicked spirits, hateful to God and enemies to all human
kind? Does he upbraid them with their wicked crimes, by which
they were given over to a reprobate sense, as he twists it in, in his
Epistle to the Romans? N owise, for it was not as yet expedient,
but very moderately saith, that he understood by their images and
monuments, that the Athenians were altogether given to super-
stition. The word superstition is smoother then idolatry, and this
same he mitigates by the comparative, too superstitious: and this
again he lessens by adding ‘as if ς’ what means this civility of the
apostles? Whither does he look, what does he catch at, did he fear

in public, and that not designedly, but passing by accidentally.
N either does he call them idols or monuments of impiety, but in a
smoother term σεβάσματα, which also is taken in a good meaning:
and it was designedly that he said that he saw an altar with that
inscription: ‘To the unknown Grod.⁷ What did 116 do with this
policy‘? that he might make use of their readiness to hear, if hc
would not seem to be the author of new gods, which by the
Athenians was punished with death, but he would preach that
which they long ago, though ignorantly worshipped. Now con-
sider with what words hc preacheth the unknown God: he does
not say, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,
as Peter did speaking to the Jews 3 but with a discourse so tempered
that 116 might with patience be heard even by ethnics; God that
