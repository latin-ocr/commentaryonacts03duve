of mankind still one and the same law sufficed, that they should
abstain from blood, the eating of other things being permitted.'’
But this is to be understood of mere blood, and separated from
the flesh, not of a few drops which by chance being not diligently
enough cleansed away, may remain in the veins. ‘⁶ And certainly,
(saith Grotius) as the observation of this precept (if it be not too
superstitiously pressed) is easy, 50 there are very honest reasons
for 11. For if we regard what is natural, those nations which use
such food are wont to be fierce and wild, as we see in America 3 or
if we look on what is moral, it is a most excellent and plain signifi-
eation that we ought to abstain from revenge, for he that revenges
himself is said to be fed with blood.” Origen adds another cause,
“because the devils were believed to be fed with blood.'' When
therefore Paul, 1 Cor. x. 25, saith, that is sold in the market, eat
ye, asking no question for conscience sake, must be restrained, as
Clemens Alexandrinus 1111111505,ι “conveniently to the exception of
those things which are mentioned in the catholic epistle of all the
apostles, wrote by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, recorded in
the Acts of the Apostles, and carried by Paul himself unto the
faithful.'’ Hence S. Biblis in Eusebius? being racked to make her
confess that the Christians fed upon inf-ants, generously answers3
‘⁶ How should they eat children, when it is not lawful for them to
seed on the blood even of brute beasts.” The author of the Ques-
tions and Answers to the Orthodox in Justin, q. 145: “Since,’'
says he, “blood consists of the same things as flesh does, why does
God permit the flesh of aniinals to be 0111011 but forbids the blood,
or eating of the flesh 111 the blood thereof? Answer, that in that
matter also God might separate us from the immanity of beasts,
who greedily lick up the blood of those creatures whose flesh they
devour.'’ Clemens Alexandrinus ³ having related how the Scythiaus
use to drink the blood of their horses, and the Arabians of their
camels, adds, “Thcn may such savage beasts perish, who make
blood their food3 for it is not lawful for men to touch blood, since
their bodies are nothing but flesh triinmed up with blood.” Origen
against Celsus, l. 8, tells us: “That things strangled are aninials
dead, and the blood not taken out of 1110111, which they say are 1110
food of devils, with the smell of which they are fed, and therefore
these are forbidden to be used by us, lest we should be nourished
with the food of devils, and the evil spirits should be nourished
with 115, if we feed as well as they upon strangled things.'' The
