This by some is referred to the old serpent, to wit, the devil, who
in vain setting upon the faithful is at last thrown into hell fire.
Arator, in his Apostolic History, lib. ii. :—

For the beast hanging on his hands,
Shak’d off is thrown into the burning brauds 3
It's rightly cast into the fire which it
Occasioned first, which sin did first commit,
A fite which heated hath the infernal pit.

Felc 720 lem-m. That which Christ promised to his apcstleS,
111311( xvi. 18, that they should destroy serpents, was fulfilled by
this miracle uncxpected by the barbarians. ‘⁶ And it scemS,” saith
Bochart, “that that serpent fastened itself on Paul's hand, not with
design to hurt him, but to adorn him. For a serpent twistcd
about the 'wrist or arms, was by the ancients used among the kinds
of bracelets, which is recorded by Nicostratus in Athenaeus, Philo-
stratus in his thirty-ninth epistle, Hesychius and others: as by
Nounus, lib. v. Dionysiae, a bracelet is described, which

Like serpents had its body twisted round.

6. But they tlzozlyllt that he should have swolleu. That is, that
Paul would swell to a vast bigness. “ The Greek word, πίμπρασθαι
properly is,’' saith Bochart, “to burn and be inflamed;” as also,
“to be blown up and swell by reason of heat.'' HesychiUS, πιμπρᾶν,
“ to inflame, to puff up, to burn.'' AElia-n, lib. i. cap. 57, saith that the
people called Psylli cure easily those that are bitten by a serpent
having horns like a ram, and a little body, provided they are called
before the whole body is swollen. For Dioscorides writeth that
the whole body of those that have been bitten by such a serpent
riseth into a tumour like that of the Varixes. The etymologian,
speaking of buprestis, a kind of herb, saith, ‘buprestis is so called,
as they say, because those who eat of it do swell exceedingly,’ which
in the Greek is φυσᾶσὲται. And Nicander saith of the animal
buprestis, in the 344th verse of his Alexipharmacs :—

Sometimes the heifers, sometimes gor-bellied canes,
She doth inflame.

And in his Theriacae, speaking of the haeinorrhous, ver. 306 :—

When she (loth bite, the guars all over are huge raised, or also inflamed.

For so the scholiast, πίμπραται, “it is inflatned, burnt, and scorched.’'
And a little after, πυρακτοῦνται, καὶ ἆυαβράζουσι, “they grOW fiery
and boiling hot. Nor is it otherwise taken in Lucian, when
speaking of the dipsas, a kind of serpent, hc saith, πιμπρᾶσθει ποιεῖ,
‘makes it inflamed) For it follows, ‘And they cry out,' to wit,
