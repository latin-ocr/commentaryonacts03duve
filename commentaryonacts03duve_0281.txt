After lle rose from tlze dead. These words are to be joined with
the end of the foregoing verse, 35 Camero well observes.

42. And lle commanded, &c. Lest any one should think, that
though indeed those things were revealed to the apostles, which

apostles to preach to all people that he was J appointed by God
to be the judge of the quick and the dead, did foretell, Matt.
xxiv. 14, that the gospel, by which hc should judge the world,
should be preached all over the whole earth, that it might be for
a testimony to all nations, and that then the end should come.
Which thing also these words of Paul seem to allude to, that God
shall judge the secrets of men according to the gospel by -J esus
Christ, Rom. ii. 16, 1101 therefore by any more perfect doctrine or

44. lee Holy Glzost fell on all. That is, the gifts of the Holy
Spirit were poured out upon all. From whence Peter, below,
ver. 47, and 511. xi. 17, concludes that the uncircumcised nations

tism3 seeing that God, by the pouring out of spiritual gifts upon
them, had made it evident that they were to be received by him
