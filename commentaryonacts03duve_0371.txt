leey essayecl to 90 im‘o Bithynia. Bithynia is a region of Asia

the lesser, which, making one province with Pontus (Pontus lying
eastward of it, and Bithynia westward) it is bounded upon the
north by the Euxine Sea, upon the east by Galatia, upon the
south by Asia properly so called, upon the west by the Propontis.
*⁶⁵ Bithynia,'’ saith Thomas de Pinedo, “is a region upon Pontus,
of old called Cronia, then Thessalis, then Meliande, as witnesseth
Pliny,1 in which author I think Mariandyne ought to be read for
Maliande, for so was Bithynia called of old, as Eusebius telleth in
his Chronica] Canon, where at number 594 are these following
words: ‘Bithynia was built by Phoenix, being first called Marian-
dyne.’ Upon which place Scaliger, to whom few are like in
erudition, saith, that it was not well said in Latin, Condere Bithy--
nium ,· but his opinion deceived him, for the phrase is common
both among Greeks and Latins, as Ι have noted elsewhere, I will
not therefore make needless repetitions lest Ι become wearisome
to my reader.” Servius saith2 also, that Bithynia was called Beb-
ricia. Pliny the younger governed this province with a proconsular
power under Trajan. The most famous cities in Bithynia were
Nicomedia, which Ammianus Marcellinus calleth3 the mother of
the cities of Bithynia3 Nice, famous for two councils, called by
Strabo4 the metropolis of Bithynia, and Chalcedon, where was a
council celebrated of six hundred and sixty bishops, A.C, 451.

But tlze spirit suffered them not. As much as to say, But the
Lord J esus Christ revealed to them, that he would not that at that
time they should go to Bithynia.

8. Came down to Troas. Troas is thought by some to have
been the Mediterraneous part of Phrygia, whose chief city was
Ilium called Troy, but others think that the town is noted bearing
the name of the same region, of which Pliny :⁵ ‘⁴ The chief place
of Troas was Amaxitus, then Cebrenia and Troas, itself called
Antigonia, now Alexandria, a colony of the Romans.’' It seems
it may be gathered from ch. xx. 6, and :2 Tim. iv. 13, that it was
this city Troas whither Paul came to preach the gospel of Christ,
as is clear, 2 Cor. ii. 12.
