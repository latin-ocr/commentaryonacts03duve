25. Aml z't came to pass that as Peter was coming] in. Greek, ‘⁶ But
as it happened that Peter entered-⁷⁷ That is, when Peter was just
now about to enter the house of Cornelius. “ For,” saith the most
famous Beza, ‘⁶ these things vvere not acted openly, but at Corne-
lius’s house, and that even at the threshold of his door, as appears
from ver. 27, 28.

26. But Peter, &e. Peter does not admit of a religious reverenee
to be paid him as God’s ambassador, as was in times past given to
the prophets3 because the Man J esus Christ, the only Mediator
betwixt God and men, is alone possessed of that embassy, and that
authority joined to it3 all others besides, in the matters of religion,
are not lords or masters, but fellow servants and disciples. See
Rev. xix. 103 xxii. 8, 9.

I myseff also am α man. That is, an earthly man, a minister

the Jews could not altogether avoid converse and eommeree with
strangers, they ordered the matter so, that they neither went to
their houses, nor ate with them. On this account it was that Peter
(ver. 21, 22) first speaks before the doors to the rnen sent. by
Cornelius, neither brought them into the house, until he was
assured they were those of whom he had been warned by God3
and, eh. xi. 3, Peter is aeeused by the Jews, that he had entered
the houses of men uneireumeised, and eaten with them. And
lienee is that in Justin the historian about the Jews: “Beeause
they remember they were driven fron] Egypt for fear of infeetion,
lest they should for the same reason be hated by the natives, they
eautiously avoided eommunieating with strangers: which at first
happening for this reason, became by degrees a matter of discipline
and religion.'’ And Apollonius 'Molo says, “That they do not
frequent the company of those who follow a course of life different
from the Jews.'⁷ “ Whieh,⁷' saith most famous Selden, “Josephus
plainly asserts to be true, whilst he largely defends the sanie
thing froin some of the Greek eustoms about strangers.”
