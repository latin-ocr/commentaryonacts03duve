joineth calling on God’s name with laying on of hands, 2 Kings
v. 11. Even so, God, being called upon by his apostles, did
bestow those singular gifts at the laying on of their hands, with'
which he gifted the most part of the faithful, at the beginning of
the preaching of the gospel, that they might be a most sure sign
of the faith of those that were converted to Christ, and an un-
doubted token of the verity of the doctrine of Christ. “Let us
remember,'’ excellently says Calvin, “that the laying on of hands
was the instrument of God, at which time he did give the visible
graces of his Spirit to his own. But since the church hath been
deprived of such riches, to wit, the visible graces of his Spirit,
laying on of hands would be but an unprofitable image.”

And they received the Holy Glzost. As if he should have said, God
did give unto the Samaritans converted unto Christ, and dipped
into the water, according to his precept, at the prayers of the
apostles, and their laying on of hands, the graces of his Spirit,
wherewith they, being gifted, could prophesy, and do wonders,
such as are mentioned, 1 Cor. xii.

18. And when he lead seen, &c. That is, when Simon Magus
perceived that those on whom the apostles laid their hands, did as
surely receive the gifts of the spirit, as if those gifts had been
in the apostles’ power, he will buy this power of giving those
peculiar graces unto them on whom he should lay his hands. And
indeed, because Simon did reckon the heavenly gift such a vile
thing, that he first under the gospel did attempt to purchase it
with money, the giving and receiving of an earthly price for an
holy and spiritual thing is called simony, q. 1, c. 1 Presbyter,-
and q. 1, c. 3, Altare. The canonists, notwithstanding, out of the
opinion of the schoolmen, called the buyers of holy things, simo·-
niacal persons, the sellers Giezites, from Giezi‚ Heb. Gehazi, the
servant of Elisha the prophet, 2 Kings v. 20, διο.

19. Gz‘ve me, &Q He will not buy the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
that were commonly given to believers, but that gift wherewith
the apostles alone being endued, to wit, that at their prayers those
gifts were bestowed on whomsoever they laid their handS, as if that
could be prized that is dearer than all gold.

20. Thy money, &c. As if he should say, Thy money offered
to such a wicked guse, being as it were altogether infected and
polluted with the contagion of the wickedness of thy profane mind,
abide with thee, and perish with thee in the same destruction,
