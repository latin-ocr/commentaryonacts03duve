HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION.

AMoNe the various classes of knowledge, that which relates to what
may be denominated the biography of the mind must be regarded as one
of the most important. By this expression it is intended to make a clear

excite to approval and even some admiration, they fade from the memory.
Others there are, whose peculiarities are such, or who have passed through
such courses os thought and action, as to awaken the utmost attention, and

yet are they widely different. Both admit of great changes ; but changes
upon· different grounds ; and nicely to distinguish these differe-noes is a pro-
