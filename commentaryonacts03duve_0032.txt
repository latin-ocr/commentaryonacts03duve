inhabited Samaria, did not worship the God of Israel, but each of
them adored the idols of his own country3 but many of them
having been therefore destroyed by lions, Esarhaddon took care to
send to the remnant one of the priests which his grandfather
Shalmaneser had carried away captive. This priest residing at
Bethel taught the inhabitants the worship of God, after the
manner of Jeroboam. Of the Samaritans thus ador-ing their
ancient idols, together with their new ealf, it is said, 2 Kings xvii.

there being a small differenee between adoring many gods and no
god at all. They had a temple built them at lengh by Sanhallat,
upon Mount Gerizim, where the blessings were pronounced,
Deut. xi. 29, in imitation of the temple of Jerusalem, which
temple, Hircan, the high priest of the JewS, afterwards destroyed,
two hundred years after it had been built, as Josephus reportsfl
However, though the temple was destroyed, the Samaritans con-

iv. 20: having, not by any scripture rule, as the Jews had for

patriarehs, designed that place for the public worship of God,
Gen. xii, 6, 7 3 xxxiii. 18, 20. Thus Abraham and Jacob are said to
have built an altar near to Siehem, threescore furlongs distant from
the city of Samaria, Judg. ix. 7. But seeing that the lVIount Gerizim
overlooked Sichem,3 and that the patriai-elis made choice of moun-
tains for the building of altars, it is probably conjectured that
the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob did rear an al'tar to God
upon Mount Gerizim, Gen. xxii. 23 2 Sam. xxiv. 183 2 Chron. i.

Samaritans only believed the Pentateueh of the omniscient Moses,
and thence arose the hatred between them and the Hebrews.
For, as sin entered the world by the law, so hatred invades par-
ticular societies through diversity of religion, with which distemper,
men of obscure birth and illiterate, labour3 the noble and learned
hate the vices, not thc men, because they follow this or that
religion. Whence it was, that the Samaritans traduced the high
prlest Eli as a magician, for that hc translated the sacrifices and
the worship of God, out of a schismatical boldness, to Shiloh, con-
trary to the command of God. They also condemned Samuel the
