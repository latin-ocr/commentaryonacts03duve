The church of believers is, by a metaphor, called a flock, as of sheep,
that from this appellation we may learn, that Christ’s faithful ones
should frequent the holy assemblies, and not to be wandering all
alone. Luke xii. 323 John x. 163 1 Pet. v. 2.

Over the which tlte Holy Glzost Ιιατή made you. That is, Over
which, by our ministry and imposition of hands, he did set and
constitute you. See above chap. xiv. 233 2 Tim. i. 6.

Overseers. Augustine saith,1 “Episcopus is a Greek word, and
thence brought, because he who is set over, oversees them over
whom he is set, to wit, taking care of them ; for epi is ⁶ over ⁹ and
scopus is ‘ intention ς’ therefore, if we please, we may call the office
of a bishop in Latin superintendere, ‘to oversee diligently: that he
may know he is not a bishop that delights to ‚be over, but not to
profit.” Erasmus, in his Ecclesiastes,2 “Elshop is a name of an
office not of dignity, also it is a military word, hence derived,
because he who professeth himself the captain of an army should
ἐπισκοπεῖν, that is, look down that there be nothing wanting 10 1110
soldiers under his standard.” Whence also Homer-‘³ calls Hector
ἐπίσκοπον, “ bishop.'’ Further, they who above, ver. 17, were in the
same city of Ephesus called elders or presbyters3 the same are
now called bishops, because in the apostles' time a bishop, and a
presbyter or an elder, were one and the same, one was the name
of their age, the other of their office3 as Jerome in his Com-
mentary upon the Epistle to Titus, and in his epistles to Oceanus
and Evagrius, proves from Acts xx. 17, 28, Ρ1111. 1. 1; 1 Tim. iv.
143 Tit. i. 53 Heb. xiii. 173 1 Ρο1. v. 1, 23 2 John 13 3 John
1. Therefore the most learned and incomparable Jewel, Bishop of
Salisbury, in 1115 Apology for the Church of England against
Harding,4 when Harding said, ‘They were condemned of heresy
who denyed the distinction of bishop from presbyter,' he sets in the
margin, “It is false, for then St. Paul, Jerome, and other good
men are condemned of heresy.” N either is Bishop Morton of
Durham’s answer, in his Catholic Apology,³ unlike this. “ J (“1·01110,”
says he, ‘⁶ perhapS, was of the same judgment with Acrius, neither
did the other fathers think otherwise.’' Lastly, that Theodoret,
Ambrose, Augustine, also Chrysostom, Primasius, and sedulius
had the same opinion as St. Jerome about the 0111111111)Υ of elders,
or presbyters and 1115110115, which opinion was condemned in Acrius,
then in the waldenses, and lastly in Wickliff, Michael de Medina
