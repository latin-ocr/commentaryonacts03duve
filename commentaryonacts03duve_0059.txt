‘ Itinerary printed at Leyden, ¹ places between Persia, Chorasan,

Mesopotamia, and Armenia. From Elam the son of Shem, Gen.
x. 22, Elimae takes its name, a province of the Assyrians joining
to Persia, near Susiana, the chief city of which was Elymais,
wherein stood the temple of Diana, opulent in silver and gold,
and rich presents, many of which were given by Alexander the
the Macedonian king, 1 Mac. vi. This city Antiochus Epiphanes
would have sacked for the riches of the te1nple; for which reason
he was struck from heaven with sudden death, says Polybius the
Megalopolite, mentioned by ,Iosephusff Though Josephus relates,
that it was more probable that that accident befell him because
he would have plundered the temple of Jerusalem. In like
manner Menander, an ancient historian, cited by Josepl1us‚³ at-
tributes the cause of those rains, which sacred history relatos to
have fallen upon the pray ers of Elijah the prophet, 1 Kings xviii.
45, to the supplications of Ithobalus king of the Tyrians. The
same Antiochus endeavoured to take Persepolis, and to rob its
temples ; for gold and silver are nowhere safe, 2 Mac. ix. Whether
Persepolis and Elymais be the same, Ι know not. The inixa·-
bitants of the province of Elymae, called by Luke Elamitcs, by the
Syrian interpreter Elanaeans, or Elanites, by Strabo and other
Elymaeans, and described to be fierce and warlike bow-men by
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, lived upon the spoil, and were the
only neighouring people that durst make head against the Par-
thians, and are said by Strabo, lib. xi„ to have exacted tribute
from the kings of Persia. These Elymaeans were always subject
to their own proper kings, of whom Jeremiah and Strabo make
mention. Two of these are upon record, Chedorlaomer is one, the
other is Arioch, Gen. xiv. 13 Judith i. 6. However, though
Strabo rightly distinguisheth the Elymaeans from the Susians,
whom Eustathius and Eusebius derive from Shelach, or Sela,
‘the son of Arphaxad, and from the Persians, whom Bochart
and Heidegger deduce from Sabtha, the son of Cush3 yet Elam
is often taken not only strictly for Elymais, but also for all the
neighbouring nations lying upon the river Eulaeus, as the Gabians,
Carbians, Massabitics, whose provinces the geographer attributes
to the Elymaeans and the Susians3 for Benjamin Tudelensis in his
Itinerary takes Chuzistan, or the province of Susia, to be the
same with Elam. The Arabian interpreter, newly printed at Paris,
