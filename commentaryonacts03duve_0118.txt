saith he, “command those things which are not contrary to the ·

sacred scriptures, let the servant be subject to the master. But if
he command those things that are repugnant to it, let him rather
obey the Lord of the spirit, than the master of the body.'’
Again,¹ ‘⁶ If it be good which the emperor or governor commands,
let him obey the will of the commander3 but if it be evil, answer
from the Acts of the Apostles, We ougylet to obey God ratker than
men, Acts v. 28. The same is to be understood concerning ser—
vants toward their masters, wives toward their husbands, and
children toward their parents, that they ought only to be obedient
to their masters, their husbands, their parents, in those things
which interfere not with the commands of God.'’ The same
Gratian in the same place, out of St. Austin’s sixth Sermon upon
the words of the Lord: W lzosoever resists tlte power, resists the
orde‘nance of God. “But what if he command that which it
behoves thee not to do? Here, indeed, out of sear of powers

If the governor command anything to be done, is he not to be
obeyed? Nevertheless, if the proconsul command the contrary,
thou verily dost not contemn the power, but choosest to obey the
more supreme authority. Again, if the proconsul command one
thing, and the emperor command another, can any person doubt
but that the latter is to be obeyed, the first to be disobeyed‘? So
if the emperor command one thing and God another, what think
ye? Pay your tribute, obey me, right3 but not in the idol
temple. He sorbids obedience in idol temple. W ho forbids?
The higher power. Pardon nie3 thou threatenest me with impri-
sonment, He with hell-fire. Here faith is to be made use of as a
shield, by which thou mayest resist all the fiery darts of the
enemy.'' The same author in the same place:C “ The emperor
Julian was an infidel. WVas hc not an apostate, a wicked person
and an idolater‘? Christian soldiers served a heathen emperor.
{ut when it came to the cause of Christ, they only acknowledged '
him, who was in heaven. WVhen he commanded them to worship
idols, and offer incense to them, they preferred God before him.
But when he bid them take the field, and march against such a
nation, they obeyed him immediately. They distinguished their
eternal Lord from their temporal lord. And yet in obedience to
their eternal Lord they were subject to their tempor-al lord.’'
