516 THE ACTS or THE Hom APOSTLES [CHAP. XXVI.

even Plato said, in his Apologetio, ’ἐγυω οὖν καὶ περὶ τῶν ποιητῶν ἐν
ὀλίγῳ τοῦτ-οε ‘in a little,’ that is, almost, ‘ I have known the same
of the poets? ’⁷

English, thou persuadest me to be a Christian. Nothing stood in
way of it why he did not receive the doctrine of Christ more fully
but his vices, which Agrippa would not part with: not unlike to his
grand uncle, Herod Antipas, who feared John the Baptist, and
sometimes heard him gladly, Mark vi. 20, but would not obey him
when he enjoined him to put away Herodias, his brother Philip’s
wife. “ Paul's defenee,” saith Daniel Brenius, “did so far prevail
with Agrippa, that although he did not embraee the Christian
religion, yet, as ecclesiastieal histories relate, ‚he granted to tho

Christ, like to me in all things.

Except these bomls. That is, save in my prison and keepers that
are set about me. For Paul was kept free from bonds in open
prison3 see above, eh. xxiv. 23. But, as Grotius well observes,
“ Vulgar speech did not take bonds in so striet a sense as lawyers.’'
Such is that of Virgil, AEneid viii. 651.

“ And Clelia, 'scapkl from bonds, the river took.”

“For pledges are never bound,'’ saith Servius. Excellent here
is that of Calvin, as sor most part his use is: “ Truly it is very
requisite that all the godly be endowed with this meekness, that
they may ealmly bear their oross3 but that they may desire that
others do well, and as much as in them lies endeavour to ease them
