the excellent disposition of its citizens. To this purpose Apuleius
saith,¹ “ Samos is a small island in the Iearian sea, situated just
against Miletus, upon the west side of it, neither is it divided by
much of the sea from it 3 two days' gentle sailing will bring one to
either of the ports.'’ Among the illustrious men who were born
in this city Miletus, the most famous were that Cadmus, “ who,'’
as Pliny saith? ‘⁶ was the first who began to compose speeches in
prose.'’ Thales the son of Examius, the most famous of the seven
famous wise men of Greece, who was the first among the Greeks

without a roof 3 and Strabo reports,5 that it was most sumptuously
adorned with gifts of divers ancient arts. It was also famous for
its most precious wool, of which carpets were made, which for their
exceeding softness became a proverb. Histoi-iaus tellus that the
Milesians of old were stout warriors3 but afterward being addicted
to their pleasureS, they lost their warlike virtueS, with their riches
and reputation, whence eomes the proverb, “ The Milesians were
stout of old.’' Hence also the Milesian speech is taken by Apuleius
for a wanton and merry speech:6 “But I will set out various
fables for you in this Milesian speech, and will soothe your benevo-
lent ears with a pleasant whisper.'⁷
