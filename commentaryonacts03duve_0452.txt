432 THE Aors or THE Hom( APOSTLES [CHAP. xx.

Lord J esus is said, to be led (gf the Spirit unco the wilderness to be
tempted by tlte devil, Matt. iv. 1.

Not knowz'nq tlte tlzz'nys that shall befall me there. That is, know-
ing nothing certainly of these tortures whichI am to undergo at
Jerusalem.

every city where I came since Ι directed my course towards
Jerusalem.

thesseth. That is, positively foretells me.

Thac bmzds, &c That is, that at Jerusalem, where of old I
greatly persecuted the church of Christ, I shall for the same
chureh be bound in chains, and all manner of ways tortured.
