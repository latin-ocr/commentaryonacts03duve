thian. Its principal cities were Gortyna, Phalasarna, Cydonia,
Cnossus, the palace of Minos. Virgil, AEn. iii. ver. 104 :—

Jove's birth-place Crete lies circled 111 the main,
There is Mount Ide the nursery of our racc ;

Α hundred cities hath this wealthy place ;

0111· grandsire first, hath not my memory fail'd,
Teucrus from thence to Rhoetian confines sail'd.

For it was accounted a certain truth, that the Trojans departing
from the island of Crete under the leading of Teucrus, came into
Phrygia, and gave name to Ida a mountain in Troy, from Ida a
mountain of Crete, in which mountain, Varro affirms in his book,
which he composed of maritime places, that even in his days
J upiter’s sepulchre was visited there, as Solinus reporteth, ch. xvii.
In testimony whereof they said that Teucrus consecrated a temple
to Sminthian Apollo. For the Cretians called a mouse sminthus,
which the Trojans had in great reverence, as Strabo affi1·ms(lib.
xiii.) Crete was also renowned for that most famous labyrinth

franiedbyDaedalus at the command of Minos. Minos and Rhada-
manthus have madc it famous, who for their extraordinary justice,
were fabled by poets to be judges of the infernal regions3 of whom
Minos also gave laws to the Cretians. Lycurgus also, thc Laccde-
monian legislator, extended its fame by his volutary exile. Epime-
nides, and George the Trapezuntian, a famous philosopher, were
also Cretians3 the former wrote of the nature of things in verse, as
Lucretius did amongst thc Latins. George the Trapezuntian,
although he was born in Crete, yet he would rather have his name
from Trapezunt a city of Capadocia, whence his father’s family had
their origina13 he very much admired Aristotlc, but made light
account of Plat03 116 translated many pieces out of the Greek into
Latin, nor did he write a few in Latin. They say that in his
utmost old age he forgot all things, even his own name, of which
see Vossius of the Latin historians, lib. iii. cap. 8.

Overpast Salmone. The eastern promontory of Crete, over against
Cnidus and Rhodes, which otherwise they call Salmonium.
‘⁶ The1·efore,'’ saith Bcza, “they were forced to turn aside to the
left hand, that they might turn in from the eastern point of Crete
to the southern coast.''

8. And scarcely. That is, and with great difficulty, by reason of
contrary winds.

Sailinq near it. That is, sailing or passing by that promontory.
Greek, παραλεγόμενοι, “ eoasting by.” Παραλεγέσὲαι is a word used
