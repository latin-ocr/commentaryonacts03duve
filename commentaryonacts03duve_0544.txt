where Servius: “ Praeterimus ,· we pass by. A speech drawn from
mariners, because that by hailing up their eablc, that is, by gather-
ing it in, they escape rough places.”

We came to a certain place. Of the said island of Crete.

W‘lzz'clc z's called tlzeGoodHavens. [Latin, Qui vocatur Boniportccs]
In Greek, as also the English, it is Fair Havens. Καλὴ ἄκτη, that
is, “pleasant shore,” a city of the Cretians, as Stephan and Ptolemy
say,² of Euboea as Herodotus (lib. vi. cap. 23), of Cicilia, which by
Cicero is called Calata, and its inhabitants Calatini.

„Nifflz wlcerezmto was tlte city Thalassa. Greek, Λασαία. “ There
is no mention,” saith Beza‚’' of the city Lasaea in any geographers
that I ever read. Pliny reekoneth Lason also among the cities of
Crete, but an inland town. Ptolemy also calleth a certain city
Lissen, but next to the eastern part of it. The Vulgate Latin
instead of Lasaea has Thalassa, which Jerome says, is corrupted, and
would have it read Laraea. But what if this, as well as that, be
corrupted? For in Stephan I find the city Thalassa, but its situ-
ation is not described. I had rather therefore read it Elaia, which
is reckoned by Pliny among the principal maritime cities of Crete.”

began to be dangerous. ’

Because the fast was now already past. Luke describes the time
according to the custom of the Jews, and uses the fast for the
time that the fast was kept. ‘⁶ But seeing,” saith the famed Hein-
sius, “it is said absolutely jejunium, ‘ fast‚’ there is no doubt but that
it is to be understood of that fast which is called great, or ἒἾὌΠ ῠἾ3;
which is also called ΕΗΒ Dr, ‘ fast-(lay‚' absolutely and compendiously
w, which is nvnmrr nr, ‘ day of purification, or expiation.’ On which
day the Jews gave themselves over to very great lamentation, so
that for above the space of twenty-four hours, they, clothed with
white garments, pray and fast without interruption: that so they
may detest the memory of that horrid sin, to wit, that of making
the calf, and may avert the punishment due to so great a wicked-
ness. Which fast falleth on the tenth moon of September, in
which month, as the seven stars called Pleiades set, so also the sea
begins to be tempestuous.’‘ Of this solemn annual fast of the Jews,
see Lev. xvi. 29, &eg xxiii. 27, &c.
