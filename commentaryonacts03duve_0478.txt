Tauyht. Interpreters commit an error while they connect the
words, at the feet of Gamaliel, with the word tauqlzt, because it
rather agreeth with the foregoing words, br0u9ht up in tlzz‘s city,
and Paul signifies, that he was fed and was brought up at the feet
of Gamaliel, but not that he was instructed in learning at
Gamaliel’s feet. The Syrian interpreter takes the words in the
same sense, whence it is that he is so careful in leaving a difference
between Paul’s nativity, education, and instruction, by copulative
and disjunctive particles. He translateth the words thus: “I am
a man, a J ew, and was born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up
in this city at the feet of Gamaliel: and I was* perfectly instrueted
in the law of our fathers.'' Furthermore, in Gamaliel’s time, the
scholars stood as they were taught by their masters, who used to
sit. For so the rabbins deliver ,in Megilla, p. 21, a, that from the
time of Moses to that of Gamaliel, scholars in no other postures
save that of standing, attended the instructions of their masters,
who taught sitting. But that after the death of Gamaliel, the
world was more than ordinarily inf'ested with diseases, aud so that
custom was introduced for scholars to sit by their masters as they
imbibed their instructions. Whence it is said in Mishna, “that
after Gamaliel’s death the reverence of the law vanished.” But
that this was a custom amongst the ancient Jews, that the teaehers
sat, and the scholars aud other auditors stood upright on their feet,
appears plainly from the gospel, as you may see, Matt. v. 1——33
xxiii. 2 3 and if we credit the authority of the Syrian interpreter,
Mai-k iv. 1. But since the time that it became a custom for
scholars to sit by their masters, to wit, after Gamaliel's decease, a
little before the destruction of the second temple, the master used
to sit at the head, and the scholars, in time of teaching, used to sit
by him on each side semicircle-wise3 nor did any sit behind the
back of the teacher, “that they might all behold their master, and
hear his discourse,'’ saith Maimonides.2 But though none of the
Pharisees or scribes before the decease of Gamaliel, used sitting as
a common posture both to teacher and hearer, yet that Christ
sometimes used it, and out of tenderness to his hearers, sometimes
permitted them, contrary to the received custom, after they had
stood longer than ordinary, to sit down, that they might refresh
