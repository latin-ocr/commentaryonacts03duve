16 THE AC'rs OF THE now( APOS'PLES [OHAP. l'.

“ Τ11611,” saith 116, “ 5116 gave decent reverence to the places where
the steps of our Saviour had trod.” Which was not spoken
particularly of Mount Olivet, but in general of all J udea, “ where
Christ as man was born, where 116 561 1115 sacred footsteps, where
walked his adorable feet, where so many and so great miracles
were wrought by 111111.”1

Α cloud received him out of their squhz‘. N ot that the cloud,
which having received Christ took him from the sight of the
apostles, was to him any assistance in his ascension3 for a cloud is
no solid body that can afford any such help. Besides, the highest
clouds do not 1156 above a mile or two above the earth, being
only nourished by the exhalations of the land and water3 but 11
was for state and grandenr. Thus 11 15 said of God himself, tho
maheth the clouds his charior, Ps. civ. 3. And that other, He
maheth darkness hz‘s secret place, Ps. xviii, 11. For obscurity and
gloominess get devotion and reverence to sacred things.

10. And while they loohecl. That is, with more eager eyes and
diligent marking. ”

As he went up. That is, into heaven, as appears by the follow„
ing verse.

Behold two men. That 15 10 say, angels in human shape.

In white apparel. White, of all 00101115,15 1116 most pure and
spotless; it admits no defileincnt, and borrows nothing from any
other mixture3 therefore it 15 1116 most proper emblem of candour
of mind, justice, and sanctity. Thus the angels both here and in
other places, as also the martyrs, and all the saints in heaven,
where there is nothing of contamination 10 116 found, are said 10 116
elothed in white garments, Matt. xxviii. 33 Mark xvi. 53 John xx. 123
Rev. iii. 4, 53 iv. 4, 6, 11 3 vii. 3, 13. ‘⁶ And indeed,” saith the most
learned Braunius,‘·' “ the Hebrews themselves confessed that white
was 1116 symbol of cleanness and sanctsty, and consequent-ly of justice
and integrity. For whoever among the priests was polluted by the
law, was bound immediately to put off his white garments, as being
unworthy to wear them, and after he had put on black to depart
out of the temple. To which that of St. John seems to have
relation, where he says, They who have not dqfiled their yarments
shall walle in white, because they are worthy, Rev. iii. 4. And for
that reason 1116 11711116 colour in the garments of the highpriest
signified the innocency‚ justice, and sanctity of Christ. Therefore
