our voyage.

From Tyre we came to Ptolemais. A town of Phoenicia, formerly
called Ace, 01· with a Latin termination Aca. It is mentioned by
Pliny in these words ε2 ‘⁶ Ptolemais, which was formerly called
Ace, was a colony of Claudius Caesa1·.” Delecampius takes notice
that it was named Acon in an ancient manuscript, which cometh
nearer the original name of that town Aello, or Accho, which we
read, Judges i. 31, in the Hebrew text, and here in the Syriae
version. It is said by J osephus³ to be a city of Galilee, but that
part of Galilee belonged to Phoenicia, and Phoenicia and Palestine
were comprehendes] under Syria3 whence writers ascribed their
cities sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other. It was an
ancient and great city, which the Persians made use of as a seat of
war against Egypt, as Strabo relateth.⁴ The coast betwixt this
and Tyre, was encompassed with banks of sand, whence they were
furnished with sand for making of glass, as Strabo and Josephus
report in the forecited places3 the latter of whom calls it Arce
and Actipus,5 which Fuller alleges⁶ ought to be utterly exploded as
monsters of words, but without any solid ground3 for, according to
Justus, the Hebrew in Acho, this city was likewise called Arce.
Ace, therefore, and Arce, was the same individual town, as Da-
meshek and Darmeshek was the same city which the Latius called
Damascus. By Ptolemy it was called Arca‚⁷ and reckoned among
the Mediterranean towns of Phoenicia. Elius Lampridius, in the
life of Alexander Severus, calls it Arca Caesarea and Arcena, who
likewise says that this emperor was born there, and that on his
birth-day there was seen in the same city a star of the first magni—
tude from morning till night. Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, in
the first book of his Chronicles reports, that Alexander the emperor,
