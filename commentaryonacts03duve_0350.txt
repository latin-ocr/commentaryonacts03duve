330 THE Ae'rs or 'fflm nom( Al’os'rmsss [CHAP. xv.
expressly permitted to strangerS, Deut. xiv. 21. And yet even
the stranger was under pain of death prohibited to eat blood, Lev.
xvii. 10—12. But it is not credible, that the apostles, who so
studiously did remove all the rest of the burdens of the Mosaical
law peculiar to the Israelites from the converted Gentiles, would
yet impose upon them any more hcavy one, than what all N oah's
posterity were obliged unto. But this they would have done, if
they added a prohibition of things strangled, which belonged to
the peculial· discipline of the Israelites3 as also did that accurate
manner of killing beasts, and cleansing them from their blood, of
which we read, 1 Sam. xiv. 33, 34. Resides, it is not difficult, if
care be used, to wash away and separate the blood from creatures
strangled, or that die of themselves3 nor‘would I otherwise,
unless that be done, have Christians at this day to eat thereos, that
they may show how much they regard this apostolical constitution.
Although I do not think that piety consists in those smaller
matters, which relish of J udaism, but that it suffices to avoid sin
if never any blood separated from the flesh be eaten.”

And blood. In some Greek copies there is added, “ And what-
ever they would not have done to themselves, not to do to others,'⁷
which also is repeated (in those copies) afterwards at the end of
the twenty-ninth verse, changing the third person to the second.
These additions both Irenaeus and Cyprian read in the places (of
their works) before quoted 3 the Ethiopic interpreter retains them,
and the Complutensian edition of the Greek, “which (saith Cur-
cellreus) was printed according to the most correct and ancient
copies, and deservedly obtains the first place amongst modern
editions.’'

Concerning the prohibition of blood we shall treat more largely
afterwards, ver. 29. This only I here observe, that there is a
particular blessing promised to those that abstain from eating of
blood, Deut. xii. 25. And that the very saine phrase in the
commination (or threatening) against blood-eaters used Lev. xvii.
10, is made usc of again, Lev. xx. 5, where most grievous punish-
ment is dcnounced against idolaters. And that the same is
nowhere used besides against the transgressors of any third
precept, but only in those two cases of idolatry and eating of
blood, is noted by Maimonides. More N evochim, p. 3, cap. 46.

21. For Moses, &c. It is beyond doubt, that the intention of
J ames in these words was to give a reason for his judgment, but
to which part thereof it relates is not very plain. Cureellaeus
