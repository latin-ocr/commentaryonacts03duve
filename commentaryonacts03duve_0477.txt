CHAPTER XXII.

1. Men, brethren, and fathers. See above, ch. vii. 2.

Hem· ye my defence which I now make unto you. That is, my
defence, whereby I vindicate myself from the accusation of my
adversaries.

2. And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew touque. See
above, ch. xxi. 40.

They kept the more silence. Because the Hebrew was more
acceptable to them, as being Hebrews.

And he saith. Paul further continued his discourse thus.

3. I am verilya man which am a Jew. Deducing my original
from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Born in Tarsus, α city of Cilicia. See above, ch. vii. 93 vii. 583

Brouyht up. Not from his childhood, which it is probable he
passed at Tarsus in his own country, but from his youth, viz„
that Paul having been from a child carefully brought up in the
Greekish learning, now become a youth, came to Jerusalem, in
regard he was a J ew by nation‚ that he might be there instructed

Of this Gamaliel see above, ch. v. 34.

In this city. Jerusalem, the chief city of the Jews.

him in sacred and profane things as his fellow3 but rather humbly
professes that he was prostrate as it were at the feet of that great
doctor, and whose memory, being lately deceased, was in high
veneration among all the J eWS, and that in this low state he took
his entertainment of him. This is usual among the Jews, that
speaking reverently of others, they lay themselves as it were at
their feet. Abigail is an excellent instance of this, 1 Sam. xxv. 41 3
And she arose and bowed her face to the earth, and said, Belzold let
chine handmaz'd be α servant to wash the feet of the servants ofmy Lord.
To the same purpose is that excellent saying of J ose, son of Joeser,
in Pirke Avoth, ‘Let thy house be a receptacle for the wisc, and
roll thyself in the dust of their feet.' For this saying has no other
sense than what the commentators have expressed it in, that is, by
