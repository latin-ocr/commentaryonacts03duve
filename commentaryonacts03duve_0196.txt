for that purpose, and presented the calf that came out of it to the
people, built an altar to it, and appointed a solemn feast to be kept
the next day, as it is more fully declared, Exod. xxxii. Hence,
Deut. ix. 20, it is said, that God was mightily incensed against
Aaron, and was about to destroy him, and would certainly have
. cut him off had not Moses interceded for him.

And offered sacrffice tanto the idol, &c. The Israelites came
together according to Aaron’s appointment early next morning,
worshipped the calf, and offered burntaeofferings and peace-offerings
to it, and the people sac down to eat and clrz'nle, and rose up to play,
Exod. xxxii. 6. For they worshipped this idol after the same
manner that they did the true God. Except that of all the kinds
of sacrifices the sin-offerings were only omitted, which yet they
stood most in need of. And how guilty sover they were, yet they
thought they had performed their sacred rites aright, and their
consciences were benumbed with acting so great wickedness.
F easting and festival plays were appendices of the sacrifices, even
in the worship of God. For whereas sacrifices were either burnt- >
offerings, or sin-offerings, or peace-offerings3 in burnt-offcrings all
the sacrifice was burnt3 in sin-offerings a part of it fell to the
priest's share, who only feastcd on it3 in peace-offerings the offerers
according to their right retained a certain portion of the sacrifice,
that they might call together their friends, if they so thought fit,
and be merry with them. For in these feasts the Israelites were
commanded to rejoice before the Lord, Dcut. xii. 73 xvi. 11, yet
not with a light, lascivious, and petulant, but with a pious and
moderate joy, conjoined with a praisiiig God's name, as in the
presence of the all-seeilig God. And that plays were also then
used, appears by David's example, whom Michal out at a window
spied dancing‚ and playing, after he had offered sacrifices before
the ark, 2 Sam. vi. 163 1 Chron. xv. 29. But whereas Platol
saith, that some dance ἐμμελῶς, with a modest and becoming
motion of the body, others πλημμελῶς, immodestly and unseemlily:
undoubtedly David’s dancing was ἐμμέλεια, modest, and composed,
not desultory and light. “ But idolaters,” saith the most renowned
ssoohartss “were so bad personators of the faithful in this point,
that they did not contain themselves within these bounds. For
these sacrificial feastings frequently ended in drunkenness, or
lasciviousness, or contention‚ riots, beatings‚ and slaughters.
