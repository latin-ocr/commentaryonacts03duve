Christ and through Christ, either in this or that, in more or fewer
languages. But it appears out ofl Cor. xii. 10, 28, 30, xiv.
2, 4, 5, &c., that they are under a mistake who assert that there
was any miracle wrought in the ears of the auditory‚ as if that
though the disciples of Christ spake only one sort of lang-uage, yet
that their speech was understood by all, as if they had spoken
distinctly in their several idionis.

Utterance. The Greek word is interpreted by Tarnovius,¹ “so
to utter a speech that there should be a great efficacy in every
word, and much wisdom contained in every perlod.” Paul opposcs
the same word to those who after the manner of fanatics talk
*much, but vainly, and to little purpose, Acts xxvi. 25. Bcza says
also, “ That they are properly said to utter a speech according to
the signification of the Greek word, who speak things sententious
and enlivening, such as were those which St. Luke soon after calls
the wonderful works of God. As also such as spake not their
own thoughts, but by the impulse of Divine inspirati0n3 as it is
written of the prophets, 2 Pet. i. 21 ; which was that which Luke
altogether purposed to express here by this Greek word, and the
Latins use to declare by fari a more significant word than loqui,
though this distinction is not always observeds'

5. But there were dwelliny in Jerusalem. According to the
Greek, “inliabiting.” That is to say, as the learned Mede ex-
pounds it, “sojourning together3 ’³ including those who resorted
together from other countries to celebrate the feasts of the Paschal
Lamb and Pentecost3 for which purpose they took up their
lodgings in the city, as is apparent by what follows. It is true
that the Greek words denote a fixed and durable habitation. But
among the Hellenists, whose dialect the writers of the New
Testament imitate, they are indifferently made use of for a longer
or shorter abiding in one place3 that is, as well for sojourning as
for inhabiting: as the two following examples plainly prove from
the translation of the Septuagint. The first is Gen. xxvii. 44,
where the Greek word oz'kez‘n, and the Latin word habitare in the
Vulgate version, signify to “tarry afew days.'' The latter example
is in l Kings xvii. 20, where Elias speaking of the widow where
he was wont to lodge, uses the word katoz'leein, for sojourning,
“with whom Ι sojourn3’' both the forementioned Greek words
