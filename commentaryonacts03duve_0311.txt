betwixt that and the dividing of the land, they make up four
hundred fifty-one years and a half, which Paul calls about four
hundred and fifty years.’' Famous Ludovicus de Dieu saith
somewhat otherwise. “I altogether agree with them,'’ saith he,
“who will not have reckoned here the years wherein the judges
ruled3 (for thus it seems impossible to make the four hundred and
fifty agree with the four hundred and eighty years, which were
from the coming out of Egypt to the beginning of the temple of
Solomon, l Kings vi. 13) but these which passed from the birth of
Isaac till the time of the judgeS, as if it were written, And after·-
wards, about four hundred and fifty years, he gave judges: to tell,
not how long the judges ruled, but when God gave then13 to wit,
after these things which were declared, ver. 17—19, which were
acted in about four hundred and fifty years. The account agrees.
For from Isaac to Jacob’s birth are sixty years, thence to the
going into Egypt a hundred and thirty3 thence to the coming out
of Egypt two hundred and ten3 thence to the entering into the
land of Canaan forty3 thence to the (lividing of the land seven
years 3 which together make four hundred forty and seven years3
that is, about four hundred and fifty, for there are only three
wanting. For that in ver. 17, G'od chose our fathers, is rightly
referred to the time of Isaac's birth, because that then G0d‚ who
had already chosen Abraham of all the people of the earth, did of
all Abraham's children choose Isaac, in whose family the covenant
should stand, saying, In Isaac· shall thy seed be called.”

He yave unto them judyes. These judges among the Hebrews
were directly like to the Roman interreqes, and afterwards to the
dictators3 neither did they differ in any thing from the Hebrew
kings, but that they had not a guard and royal pomp, and there-
fore exacted not taxes nor tributes; nevertheless, they were, as
Josephus speaks, governors with a sovereign power, and therefore
are called kings, Judg. ix. 16. They made Abimelech king, that
is, judge. WVhen Samson was dead, Judg. xviii. l, In those days
there was no kz'ny in Israel, that is, judge. And as the kings had
power of killing without the Sanhedrim, as the Talmudic title
ΓἾἼΠΞΕ), and 2 Sam. i. 15, and other places teach3 so had also these
judges, as appears from the examples of Gideon, Judg. viii. 16, 17,
and Jepthah, Judg. xii. 6, which things are rightly observed by
Abarbanel in the beginning of the book of the Judges. Josephus
useth also to call those judges by the name of prophets, because
