Cryz'ny. Like jangling follows in a court, whose oustom is to
fill the court with bawling and ories, even to hoarseness, to deafen
the judge's ears. Hence Cicero calls them² both bawlers and out-
oriers: ‘⁶ We seek not for I do not know what lawyer, nor bawler,
nor jangler in this our discourse.’' And lib. iii. de Orator„ he
saith of Pericles: ‘⁶ But 110 bawler hath taught him to bark out
his hour.'' Quintilian also calls them barkers :2 “Above all
things that modesty perisheth which brings authority and belief to
an orator, if he of a good man become a jangler and a barker.’'

As much as to say, These vagabonds who by introducing their new
religion stir up sedition in every nation, are also come to this city
of Thessalonica, to the end they may trouble us, who are at peace,
with their new doctrines. Well saith Calvin, ‘⁶ This is the state
of the gospel, to have these uproarS, which Satan raiseth by
opposing it, imputed to it. This also is the maliciousness of
Christ’s enemies, to lay the blame of tumults upon holy and
modest teachers, which they themselves have procured. Certainly
the gospel is not preached to this end, to stir up men to strifes
among themselves, but rather that it may keep them in peace,
being reconoiled to God. When Christ liberally invites us there
to come unto him, Satan and the wicked rage 3 therefore Paul and
Silas might easily have defended themselves, but it was requisite
for them to undergo this false slander for a time, and 50 long as
they were not heard, silently to pass it by. And the Lord, by
their example, meant to teach us not to give place to slanders or
false reportS, but rather to stand stout in asserting the truth, being
content to be evil spoken of, for what was well done. Therefore
away with the perverse wisdom of some who, to escape false
slanders, stand not to betray Christ and his gospel by their
trcacherous moderation, as if their good name were more preoious
than Paul's, and such like, yoa, than the sacred name of God,

- which is not free from blasphemies.’'
