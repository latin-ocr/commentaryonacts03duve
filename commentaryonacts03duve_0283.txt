the foregoing chapter, and in the same words 3 where if any thing
in it need explaining, the reader may have recourse.

12. We entered into tlze man’s house. That is, into his house,
for entering into which you chid me.

15. But when I began to speak. As if he should say, whilst I
was earnestly discoursing with them, and they believed me. See
what we said, ch. i. 1.

As on αδ. Apostles and other believing Jews.

16. How that lze said. That is, what he said, to wit, when he gave
us the command concerning the promise of the Father to be ex-
pected at Jerusalem, and about our staying there, until we were
endued with power from on high3 as you may see, ch. i. 5, com-
pared with Luke xxiv. 49.

Jolm, &c. See our notes on ch. i. 5.

17. Is, therefore, &c. Peter says he cannot denya brotherly com-—
munion with the Gentiles, on whom the pouring out of the gifts
of the Holy Ghost doth manifest them to be adopted God’s

body of the church was rent, it happened that by the dispersion
of those that fied, the gospel was spread amongst far distant
countries, which before was enclosed, as it were in a barn, within
the walls of one city. And so it came to paSS, that the name of
Christ passing over seas and mountains, became known to the
remotest parts of the world. And thus, according to the prophecy
of Isaiah, ch. x. 22: The consumption lzatlz ovevflown in riyhteous-
ness. See our notes, ch. viii. 1.
