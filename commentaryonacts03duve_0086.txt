customs of the church, in regard thc words of Christ arc the
foundation upon which all church customs are to be built, that
they may be safe and laudable. VVhatsoever savours against the
words of Christ, savours against the truth3 and as Tertullian says,
‘⁶ WVhatevcr savours contrary to truth is heresy, though it be an
ancient custom.’' It is in the power of God to pardon those that
err out of simplicity. “But because we erred once, we are not
always to go on in our errors,'' as St. Cyprian admonishes well ;1
“ it being more proper for the wise, and those that fear God, to
obey the manifest and open truth freely, and without delay, than
obstinately and pertinaciously to resist it.'’ Scotus having alleged
the judgment of Alexander the Third, touching the baptizing of
those of whom it was doubted whether they were baptized or no,
takes an occasion to recommend three maxims.² The first is,
“Where there is a possibility, the safest way is to be chosen.'’ Δ
Secondly, “WVhere there is no possibility, the next to the safest
way is to be made choice of.'⁷ Thirdly, “then impossibility
ceases, everything is to be supplied which impossibility would not
admit.'’ These maxims, so agreeable to reason, whoever intends
to follow will never question but that they ought to be baptized,
if they have not received that baptism ordaincd by Christ, but
only the rhantism, that is, the sprinkling substituted in its room
by a vulgar use, or rather abuse, as Luther calls it. See chap. viii.
38, “Nor is it to be doubted,” saith that famous divine, John
Forma-‘³ ‘⁶ but that they are again to be baptized who before have
only received a vain washing, and not the true sacrament of
baptism. And though it be not so great as the papists imagine,
yet is the necessity of this sacrament very great, and the pmfit
and advantage very considerable.'’

In tlze name of Jesus Christ. That is, professing a faith in
Christ not seigned, as wc may collect from chap. viii. 37. See our
annotations upon the place. Or, in tlte name <ff Jesus Christ is the
same with z'n Jesus Christ5 as St. Paul speaks, Rom. vi. 3: Are με
iynorcmt that whosoever of us are baptized in Christ Jesus, accord-
ing to the Greek, “ into Christ Jesus,” we are baptized in lzz‘s death,
the Greek has it, “into his death.'’ Upon which words, Eulogius
of Alexandria :⁴ ‘⁶ To be baptized into J esus Christ, signifies to be
baptized according to the precept and tradition of Christ 3 that is,
