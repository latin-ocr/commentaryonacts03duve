law and the prophets.

Thougylzt. By a preposterous zeal for the law of Moses, and
burning with a pertinacious and mad rage. Lactantius, the most
famous for eloquence amongst the assertors of Christian verity,
thus refels the Gentiles who defended their religion by tormenting
those that dissented from them :2 “ But,” say they, ‘⁶ sacred rites
publicly professed are to be defended. O with how honest a
desire do these miserable men err! for they think that there is
nothing in human affairs inore excellent than religion, and that
it must be defended with the utmost power3 but as they are mis-
taken in the religion itself, so are they in the kind of defence.
For> religion must be defended not by killing, but by dying3 not
by cruelty, but by patience3 not by wickedness, but by faith.
For those are the deeds of evil men, these of good3 and it is neces-
sary that good be practised in religion, not evil. For if ye will
defend your religion by blood, if by torments, or evil, it will no
more be defended, but polluted and violated. For there is nothing
so voluntary as religion, in which, if the mind of its professor is
averse, it is straight vanished, it is now none. There is therefore
good reason that ye should defend religion by patience or death,
in which if saith be preserved, it is both well-pleasing to God, and
addeth authority to religion.” Socrates relateth, Hist. iii. 21, that
Jovinian the emperor was mightily commended, because he per-
mitted every man to profess religion as he thought fit, and every
one to worship as he pleased. So Flavius JosepIms, in his Life
writeth, that every one ought κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ προαίρεσιν, “ accord-
ing to his own choiee worship God ;'’ ἀλλὰ μὴ μετὰ βίας, but “ not
by consti-aiut, neither ought we to act so as to give cause to others
to repent that they came over to us on the account of security.”
Athanasius, Apol. 2: “Deaths and bonds are far from being
allowed by our religion.’' Tertullian to Scapula, cap. xi.: ‘⁶ We
worship one God whom ye naturally know, at whose lightnings
and thunder ye tremble, at whose benefits ye rejoice3 ye also
fancy the rest to be gods, which we know are devils. Yet it is of
human right and natural liberty, that every man worship what he
thinks fit, nor does one's religion either incommodate or advan-
tage another. But neither is it the duty of religion to impose
religion, which ought to be embraced willingly, not by constraint.’'
