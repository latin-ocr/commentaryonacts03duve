it will prove prcposterous ancl full of wanderings, if it be once

“Seventlzly. Now if we will (lispute by authority, Constantine
Porphyrogennitus is not comparable for antiquity to Arator Sub-
diaconus, who, in the second Book of his Apostolical History, says
that Melita, into which Paul was cast when he suffered shipwreck,
is the isle Malta by Sicily. Neither is it a work of any difficulty
to dissipate what may be objectcd to the contrary. For the ship
arriving at Malta is said to be tossed 111 Adria, Acts xxvii. 27. Yet
not in the Gulf of Venice, the Adriatic sea having far greater
extent than that gulf 3 for the Gulf of Venice ends with Scla-
vonia, but the Adriatic sea comprehcnds all that part of the Medi-
terranean sea, which is called Ionian. Hesychius: ‘Ionium, a sea

In pursuance hereof Philostratus, lib. ii. ⁷ Imaginum, in Pale-
mone, attests that the forenamed isthmus is betwixt the Ege-an
and the Adriatic sea. Again, the same author in his Apollonius,
lib. iv. cap. 8, records that Nero had a mind to cut this isthmus, to
the end that Adria might disburden itself into the Archipelago.
The same appears by Suidas on the word Alpheus, and again ou>
