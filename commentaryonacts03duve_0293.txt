cised, among his helpers, and 2 Tim. iv. 11, desires Timothy to
bring him along with him to Rome, as one that would be very
useful to him.

Where many were yathered toyetlzer. For seeing that the believers,
of whom there was already a great number, could not meet to-
gether all in one body, they divided themselves into divers congre-
gations in several houses to pray to God for Peter3 see ver. 17.
From hence it appears, that when necessity and the rage of perse-
cutors force us to it, holy meetings, though in the night, are not
unlawful3 for that this meeting was held in the night is plain
from ver. 6, 18.

13. ΤΙιε door of the yate. Hebrew ἾΡᾙΠἯζἹξ). Judg. xviii. 16,
17 ; Ezek. xl. 11. “That is called,” saith Kimchi in his Book of
Roots, (ἔτη-φ, which is without the doors of the gate. For all that
which is within and without, as also the doors, and outward thres-
hold, is called ‘'w-35, inasmuch as it is joined to the door post, and
upper threshold. But that is called ‘⁶ Πῇῷ, which is always open, and
though the doors be shut, is always left open.'’

Adamsel came to see. Greek, ὑπακοῦσαι, “to hearken,’' that. is, to
spy who it was that knocked at the door so late at night. ‘⁶ She
came,” saith Grotius, “that she might know by his voice who he
was, lest she should rashly let any one in.”

Named Rhoda. Hebrew, Πὲξὲἶξξ, “ a rose.” Many women's names
are derived from flowers, herbs, and trees, as ngm'wj, Susanna, from
a lily, Πζῡῖῐῗῐ, Hadassa, from a myrtle. The Greek name Rhode,
⁶ Ρόδη, 15 3150 mentioned in the fragments of Menander.

15. Ic ῖς lais anyel. That is, a messenger sent from him. So
John the Baptist is called an angel, that is, a messenger, Matt. xi.
10. The disciples of John sent to Christ angels, messengers,
Luke vii. 24. The disciples of Christ sent into a village of the
Samaritans, Luke ix. 52. The spies sent by Joshua, whom Rahab
entertained, J ames ii. 25. This is the simple interpretation of the
Greek noun ἅγγελος; neither have we any reason to think that the
believers understood it here otherwise, since they had never heard
that heavenly angels needed to knock at the door to obtain entrance ;
and they knew it did not agree with the nature of spirits, who with
their subtleness can penetrate the most solid bodies. Therefore
they thought that the damsel, out of her earnest desire of Peter’s
deliverance, which all the godly had, had understood the messenger
discoursing of Peter, as if he had said, that himself was Peter.
