vER. xxx] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 527

Vulgate interpreter it is ‘⁶ Euro-aquilo,'' north-east, as it were the
east wind inelining to the north. “Whether‚'' saith Beza, “that he
read it Εὐροακύλων, for so likewise Luke calls Aquila, Ἀκύλανς
or, that he thence judged that this was north-east, or a wind blew-
ing from the east towards the summer solstiee‚ because the ship
was driven from the shore of Crete, partly towards the west, and
partly towards the south, to wit, towards Malta, which lies between
Africa and Sicily3 especially seeing they are said to have feared
lest they should be driven in upon the quieksand towards the
south. Therefore this conjecture does not altogether dissatisfy
me, seeing Virgil also calls the east wind tempestuous‚ and this
wind is very suitable to the winter season. Yet I have retained
the word Euroelydon, which I have found in all Greek copies I
met with3 whence it is understood that this was an east wind, and
that very stormy. For the Greeks eall a wave κλύδων. This
therefore is that which the Hebrews eall nas> :7773 the Latin poets,
‘ watery, eloudy, black‚ raging, thundering.' Therefore‚ although
the east wind did drive the ship towards the west, that is, into
Italy3 yet it is no wonder that in so great a storin they could net
keep a straight course, but were driven hither and thither by the
force of the waveS. But if this wind was north-east, it beat them
back from Italy3 and it was a wonder that the ship was not driven
in upon the coasts of Africa. The Syriae retained the same Greek
names: the Arabio cancelled the word Euroclydon, as being a
word altogether unknown to him.'’

whirlpools, “whereby the tossed ship was driven crookedly, un-
governably,'' as Quintus Curtius expresseth it, lib. ix.

And could not bear up unio ΗΜ wind. That is, ‘⁶ withstand the
wind‚'’ as the Syriae renders it. Greek, ἀντοφθαλμέιν τῷ ἀνέμῳ,
“ stand before the wind.” ’Λντοφθαλμέω properly signifies, accord-
ing to H. Stephan, “I look upon one that beholdeth 1‘ne:” ἀντι-
βλέπω ἐξ ἐναντίας, “I look over against me,’' as Suidas hath it.
Gaza in Scipio’s Dream, interpreted solem adversum intueri, “to
look upon the sun over against them,'' ἆντοφθαλμῆσαι τῷ ἦλῖῳς
ἀντοφθαλμεῖν metaphorically is, ‘⁶ to resist‚ to strive against.”
Eccles. XiX. 5, ‘O δὲ ἆντοφέπιλμῶν ταῖς vidovo? ςστεφανοῖ τὴν ζωὴν
αὐτοῦ, that is, as Drusius interprets it, “But he that resisteth
pleasures, erowns his life.'' Also Grotius observes that ἆντιβλεπεῖν
is frequently so used by Josephus. The original of the metaphor
seems to be hence, that he who opposes any turns his eyes on him‘,
