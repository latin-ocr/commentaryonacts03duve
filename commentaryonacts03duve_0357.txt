have been embraced by all the lovers of divine truth3 but, alas!
in many of them which say, It seems qood to tlte Holy Glzost and us,
there presided the spirit of ambition, covetousness, wrath, envy,
pride, ignorance, to say no worse, rather than the meek and gentle
Spirit of Christ3 what wonder is it then if no good proceeded from
thence, but that instead of composing differences they rather inul-
tiplied and increased them more and more.'’

To lay upon you 720 qreater burthen. By the word burthen are
not to be understood the moral precepts whose honesty nature
alone, and without the help of another tutor, is able presently to
teach any one. “For as,'’ saith Curcellaeus, “the political laws of
the Gentiles will not release any one from them, so neither will the
law of Christ, which is the enjoiner of a more perfect holiness.
Nor ought those things to be counted or called a burthen, which
are so honest and commendable, that of all that know them, even
although none should command them, they ought to be observed.
But certain positive laws are called a burthen, which are indeed
founded in natural honesty, but yet not so plainly as that all should
forthwith perceive it, and are of a middle nature, between those that
are absolutely moral, and such positive laws as depend merely on
the will and pleasure of the law-maker, and therefore are neces-
sarily to be oft recommended, urged, and inculcated, lest they be
unknown or neglected. Of the laws of this sort, whereof Moses
delivered many, it seemed good to the apostles to prescribe only
those here mentioned to the converted Gentiles, and especially to
free them from the yoke of circumcision, which many of them were
most averse unto, that so the difficulty of Christian discipline might
not retard the course of the gospel, and this agreeable to the sen-
tence of Peter and of J ames before, ver. 10 and 193⁷

These necessary tltz‘nqs. The Greek has πλὴν τῶν ἐπάναγκες
roim-mv: supply ὄντων, “besides these things necessarily,” where,
“to be observed,” is understood. Grotius notes, that the phrase is
purely Greek, and by Demosthenes and Plutarch used of things
which by law ought to be done, and so he translates this place
thus: ¹ ‘⁶ Resides those things which ’tis altogether necessary to be
done.’' Tertullian: “Besides those things from which there is a
necessity to abstain.’' Cyprian: “Resides those things which are
of necessity.’' But Salmasius thinks this place corrupted, “Fon’'
saith he, “in the Greek it should be read πλὴν τῶν ἐπ’ ἇνάγκες
τούτων, not. as vulgarly, ἐπάναγκες, which in this construction is
