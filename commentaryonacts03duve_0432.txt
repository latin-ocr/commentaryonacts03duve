visions seem to be put for magical visions.¹ That the Ephe-
sians were given to these damnable studies, the ancient naming
“The Ephesian Letters” doth show, by which certain characters
and small magical words were signified, whereby the magicians
used to free those from the power of denmnS, who were vexed with
them. Plutarch, in Alexandro, makes mention of the magicians
which were at Ephesus. And about the beginning of Nero’s
empire, as Philostratus witnesseth in his life, Appollonius Tyanaeus,
a famous magician, set up a public school of magic art at Ephesus.

sians of their own accord and without any violence burned
those books, which they themselves acknowledged unworthy of
light or reading, and that books, against the owner's will, with-
out being convicted of their impiety, should by violence be
forced from them, and cast into the fire. This they used to
do who cannot find out good reasons to confute the arguments of
such books.

And they countecl the price of them. Of the books, to wit, which
the Ephesians who were sincerely converted to Christ, did con-
