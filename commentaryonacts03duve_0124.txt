of our age, Stephen Cureellaeus, “the apostles were-desimus to
show their confidence in God, by openly professing that au the
endeavours of the encmies of Christ to disturb the propagation of
the gospel, should be of no effect3 nor should they be able to
hinder, but that what God had decreed should be done by Christ
and his servants for the salvation of the world, should be duly per-
formed and executed. Neither ought that transposition of the
words offend any one, or seem unusual, seeing that there be many
such in the seriptures. Of which it will be sufficient to bring two
or three examples. Rev. xiii. 8, we readz And all that dwell
upon the earth shall worship the beast, whose names are noc written in
the book of life of* the Laml) slain from the foundation of the
world. VVhere the last words, from the foundation of the world,
are not to be connected with the preceding words, the Lamb slaz'n,
but with the more remote words: thus, whose names are not written
from the foundation of the world, z'n the book of life (ff the Lamb
slain. See also a harder trajection, Luke ii. 34, 35, where the last
words, Thac the thoufshts eff many hearts may be reveccled, are to be
connected with these, aad for a sz'gm that shall be spoken ayainst,
though there be an interposition of these words between: Yea, a
sword shall pier-ce thmuqh thy own soul also. See also chap. iv. 5,
where you are to read, And the devil, takz'ny him up into αη ΙιξᾳΙι
mountain in α moment of time, shewed him all the kinydoms of the
earth ,· not as it is vulgarly pointed, “he showed him all the king-
doms of the earth in a moment of time.’⁷ For that could not be done;
besides that it was contrary to the design of the devil, which was to
detain the Lord J esus for some time at least in the contemplation
of the glory and splendour of those king-donas, to excite his desire
and ambition, not to show him passant, as it were a fiash of
lightning. Lastly, where you find any parentheses inserted in
scripture, there those transpositions are always to be found 3 which
is so frequent in the Epistles of St. Paul, that you meet with three
or four in the first seven commas of his Epistle to the Romans3
concerning which thing interpreters may be consulted, and among
the rest, Beza, and Piscator, under the word trajectio.

29. And now. The adverb of time, and now, is a collective, or
rational conjunction, inferring a conclusion out of what precedes,
and is here used for “therefore,” or “ for this 1·eason.’' As Gen.
iv. 11, 21, 23, and in other places.

Lord, behold their threatem'nqs, &c- As if he had said, Assuage
