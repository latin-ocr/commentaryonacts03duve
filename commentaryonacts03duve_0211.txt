was, according to Chrysostom, upwards of thirty years of age
when he kept the clothes of the witnesses that were laid down at
his feet. And truly, a little after, when he was converted to the
saith of Christ, he is called by Ananias, ἀνὴρ, “ a man,'’ ch. ix. 13.
Nor is it likely the high priest would have conferred so much
power on a young man, when he was yet under tutors, against the
Christians. See the same ch. ix. 23 and Paul himself below, ch.
xxvi. 4, testifieth that he spent all his youthful years among the
Jews before his conversion. Estius on the Epistle of Philemon,
saith, “That Saul the persecutor was called a youth, or rather
a young man, νεανίαν, from the age of youth, which reaches
to the thirty-fifth year, or as others say, even to the fortieth.”
Cicero, when he pleaded Sextus Roscius’s cause, calls himself a
young man, when yet at that time, according to Gellius) he was
twenty-seven years of age. Antonius, bishop of Grass, in France,
in the life of Paul, writeth that he was thirty—three years of age
when he persecuted the church of Christ. From that time to the
eleventh year of the reign of Nero, when Paul in bonds wrote the
Epistle to Philemon, by Onesimus his servant, according to bishop
Usher’s chronology, were thirty years3 and therefore, Paul, then
above the age of sixty‚ does rightly call himself Paul the aged,
seeing as we have noted on J oel i. 2, he who was sixty years old,
was called an old man by the Hebrews.

PVllzose name was Saul. This Hebrew‚ born of the Hebrews‚
descended of the tribe of Benjamin, born at Tarsus 111 Cilicia
(which city, that it was then famous for the study of philosophie
and liberal sciences, is confirmed by the authority of Strabo)‘2, by
sect a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee, did at this time apply
himself to the study of the law in the synagogue of the Cilicians
at Jerusalem, and frequented the school of Gamaliel, a doctor of
the greatest repute among the Pharisees3 being a strict observer
of the law of God, as also of the traditions of their fathers. See
below, ch. xxi. 393 xxii. 33 xxiii. 6—343 xxvi. 4, 5. 2 Cor. xi. 22.

JeSUS, as is plain by the subsequent words. The most learned
Curcellaeus saith, ³ “There is no small weight in these words of
