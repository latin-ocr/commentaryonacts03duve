Theodorct and many others, as well ancient as modern, affirm David
to be the only author of all the Psalms. Philastrius² also accounts
them to bc heretics who think otherwise. But St. Austirss wavers,
sometimes ascribing the whole work to David alone, sometimes
allowing him to have composed no more than only nine 3 affirming
the rest to have been made by the four singers, of whom he made
choiee for that purpose. But it is apparent from the arguments
of the Psalms, wherein their authors are discovered, or from the ex-

David. And thus Peter being taught the sense of the holy
scriptures by Christ, deservedly applies to Judas, the leader of the
persecutor-s of Christ, the miserable destruction foretold of his
persecutors in general. Psal. lxix. 25.
