the worst and. cursed custom of their ancestors. When we shall
be presented before the judgment of Christ, he will not judge his
disciples by custom, but by the lively and effectual word of his
gospel. Neither should any be taken with a vain hope of framing
an excuse from the authority of the church, because all the
authority of the church is from Christ, granted unto her for that
intent and purpose, that she might procure a religious ohedience to
his laws, and heavenly precepts, but not that she might break,
repeal, and cancel them? Thus far the Anonymus our country-
man, whose sound reasoning hath made the booksellers generally
suppose him to be Monsieur de la quue, the most famous pastor
of the reformed church which is at Rouen, whom his writings do
⁸ show to be inferior to none in godliness and learning. Heidegger
iu his Historico-Theological Anatomy of the council of Trent, p.
2, upon the canons of twenty-first session, saith, “ There is in the
church no more power of changing the rites of the sacramente
appointed by Christ, than there is power of changing his word and
law. For as this his word contains a sign audible, so those rites

pleased, hear ye lzz‘m. VVhereforQ if Christ alone be to be heard,
we ought not to give ear to what another before us did think meet
to be done, but what Christ did first do, who is before all: for
neither ought we to follow the custom of men, but the truth of
God, seeing God speaketh and saith by Isaiah the prophet:
Without cause they do worship me, teachc'ny the commands ancl doc—
trines of men. And again our Lord in the gospel repeateth
the sels-same thing, saying: ἵε rffect the commandment of God,
that ye may establlsh your own tradition. Julius, the first Roman
bishop of this name, in his epistle to the bishops through Egypt,
and Pascha] the Second, in his epistle to Pontius, abbot of Cluny,
do check those who did give uuto the people dipped bread for the
pel-fecting of the communion, seeing that in the first celebration,
and institution of the eucharist, Christ did give bread and wine
