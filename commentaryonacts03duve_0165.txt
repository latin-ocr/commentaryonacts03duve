have gone from Chai-ran till after Terah's decease, Gen. xii. 4, is
said expressly to have been seventy-five years of age when he
departed from Charran. If we subtract these seventy-five years
from the two hundred and five of Terah's age, the remainder will be
a hundred and thirty years. Abraham was therefore born in the
hundred and thirtieth year of Terah. And therefore when in
Gen. xi. 26, Terah is said at the seventieth year of his age to have
begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran, the meaning is, Terah began
to beget three sons, Abraham, the first in merits and dignity, but
the youngest by birt.h; the second, Na110r3 Haran, the third, whom
many will have to have been the eldest of all, seeing he was
father to Melcha the wife of Nahor, and Jescha, whom the He-
brews think to be Sarah, Abraham’s wife. Abraham, therefore,
after the death of his father went forward to the land of Canaan,

and reigned there3 his words are these ι “ Nicolaus the Damascene,
in the fourth book of his history writeth thus: ⁶ Abraham reigned
in Damascus when he was a stranger, as one who had come with
an army from the country situate above Babylon, which is called
Chaldea.'’' Nor much different is that of Justin) Trogus Pom-
peius’s Epitomist. “ The city had its name from Damascus, king
thei-eof. After Damascus, Azelus, then Adores, and Abraham
and lsrael, were kings thereof.’⁷ “Eua” as Pererius excellently
reasonetli,2 “ Abraham had sinned grievously, nor had hc fulfilled
the command of God, whereby he was enjoined to depart from
Mesopotamia into Canaan, as was fitting, if he had attempted not
only to stay at Damascus, but also making light account of God’s
promises, to purchase himself a kingdom. Add that Abraham
every where professed himself a pilgrim and stranger3 and Jacob
acknowledged the same of himself and his forefathers. He there-
fore had nowhere a proper seat and habitation, much less a
kingdom.” Nor does the account of time permit that Abraham
should be said to have made any long stay at Damascus, that he
might reign there. For, seeing the year in the which he departed
from Charran was the seventy-sixth year of his age, and the same
