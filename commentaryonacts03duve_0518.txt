of Agrippa the elder, which was the eighth of the reign of Claudius,
Herod, brother to the same Agrippa, king of Chalcis, in Syria,
died, and Agrippa the younger was by Claudius substituted in the
room of the deceased3 and, together with the kingdom of Chalcis,
he was also invested with power over the temple of Jerusalem and
the holy treasury‚ and with the right of choosing high priestS,
which the same emperor had granted to his uncle. This was the
beginning of Agrippa the younger's reign. But when he had
governed Chalcis four years, Claudius, after the twelfth year of
his reign, took it from him and transported him into a greater
kingdom, constituting him king of the tetrarchy (which was his
grand uncle Philip's), to wit, of Batanaea and Gaulanitis, or
Auranitis (which countries seem to be the same with Ituraea,
Luke iii. 1), and Trachonitis 3 adding, moreoyer, the principality
which is surnamed Lysanias, because it was of old possessed by
Lysanias, Ptolemy's son, of whom Josephussswriteth,l and more
recently by the tetrarch Lysanias, whom Luke maketh mention
of. To this greater kingdom of Agrippa the younger, Nero added
Tiberias and Tarichaea, cities of Galilee, and Julius, in Ituraea,
situated beyond Jordan, with fourteen villages conterminous to it.2
Eusebius, in his Chronicle, declareth that this Agrippa reigned
twenty-six yearS, to whom all chronologers give credit. But
Eusebius committed two mistakes: first, in that he saith that
Agrippa the younger reigned immediately after his father's decease,
contrary to what Josephus asserts.3 And also in that he is of
Ἰ opinion that the kingdom of this Agrippa ended together with the
miserable destruction of Jerusalem. As if', because twenty-six
years intervened between the beginning of the same king and the
overthrow of Jerusalem, the king himself had been also destroyed,
together with the temple and city. “Bury saith the renowned
Scaliger, “that Agrippa the younger died in the third year of
Trajan, Num. 2,116 of Eusebius's Chronicle, as J ustus of Tiberias
testified, who presented his chronological works to King Agrippa
himself. None, therefore, could more certainly pronounce about
this king's death than he who dedicated his work to him. Phocius
saith of Justus of Tiberias, ⁶ He beginneth his history from Moses,
and continucth it even to the exit of Agrippa, the seventh of
Herod's family and last of the Jewish kings, who received his
kingdom under Claudius, increased it under Nero, and further
