hibited to the new converted Gentiles3 but- the said word is by us
deservedly suspected, since it is not acknowledged by many of the
ancient fathers, yea, by some expressly rejected as supposititious 3
of whom the first and most ancient is Irenaeus, in his Third Book
against Heresies, cap. 12. Where, largely and word by word,
writing over this whole place, from verse the seventh to the
thirtieth, he makes not the least mention, either in the sentence of
J ames 01· 1110 apostle’s letter, of tkinys stranyled, which is· a
manifest token, that in the book which 110 used that word was not.
For that he did not recite it from his memory is plain by that
accurate repetition of the words, in which nothing else is wanting.
Secondly, Tertullian,¹ where he exactly recounts all other things
appertaining to this place, yet makes no mention of these things
sti-angled. Thirdly, Cypriam reciting this text takes no notice
hereof. Fourthly, Jerome, ‘on the fifth of Galatians,‘ writes thus:
“In theActs of the Apostles the history sets forth, that when
some arising from the circumcision had asserted that those of the
Gentiles that had believed ought 10 100 circumcised, and keep the
law of Moses3 the elders which were at Jerusalem, and the
apostles, being together assembled, appointed by their letters that
the yoke of the law should not be imposed upon them, nor further
observed3 but only that they should only keep themselves from
things offered to idols, from blood, and from fornication3 or, as in
some copies it is written, from ‘things strangled,' or ‘anything
strangled.' Which note shows that word was not to be found in most
of the copies which came to Jerome’s hands, and that it was not
constantly 50 read. Fifthly, Ambrose, or whoever was the author
of the commentaries which pass under his name, on the epistles3
for on Gal. ii. 110 says thus: ⁶ Lastly, here are found three com-
mands given by the apostles and elders,'whereof the Roman laws take
no notice, viz., to keep themselves from idolatry and blood, as Noah
(was commanded), and from fornication, which some sophists of the
Greeks not understanding, and yet knowing that blood was to be re-
frained, adulterate the scripture, adding a fourth command, that is,
to abstain from [things] strangled.' Now whatever may be offered
to diminish the authority of this commentator, yet none of sound
judgment can be persuaded that 110 would have durst to speak thus,
if thc word strangled, which he rejectS, had been commonly read.
And thence, at least, it appears, that this word strangled was not
then in most copies. Sixthly, Augustine recites,³ first out of
