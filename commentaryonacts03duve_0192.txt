Eyypt, sayz'ny emto Aaron, Make us qods to 90 before us, &c., and
they made a yolden ca(fi’' Rightly, therefore, Lactantius saith¹ of
the same Israelites: “They turned their minds to the profane
rites of the Egyptians, For when Moses their leader went up
into the mount, and tarried there forty days, they made an ox⁷s
head of gold, which they called Apis, which might go before them
for a sign.⁷⁷ And Jerome, 011 Hos. iv. “ It seemeth to me, that
therefore, both the people of Israel made that calf's head, which they
worshipped in the wilderness, and Jeroboam the son of Nebat set
up his golden calves, that they might retain that which they had
learned in Egypt, in their superstitious worship, to wit, that Apis,
and Mnevis were gods, which were worshipped in the shape of
oxen,’⁷ And Augustine, Ps. lxxiii. “The calf which that un-
faithful and apostatizing people worshipped, secking after the gods
of the Egyptians.’' And Basil of Seleucia, Orat. vi. “ They wor—
shipped a calf in the wilderness, even as they did in Egypt.” By
the way, note, that instead of an ox or a calf, Lactantius said, an
ox’s head, and Jerome, a ca-lf's head, as Tertullian against the Jews,
cap. i., “When the 0Χέ head came forth to them.’' And Cyprian,
Of the excellency of patience, “ that he might call an ox’s head, and
an earthly figment the guides of his journey.” And Ambrose, Of
repentance, lib. i. cap„ 8, “ easting behind their backs their faith,
they worshipped a calf's head.” And on Exodus, “ The calf‘s head
was made.⁷’ Also, “ But the following things will inform us where-
fore the calf's head went out.⁷' Also, “ Moses brake the tables of
the law, and stamped the calf's head.'’ And Optatus, lib. iii. “ In
the days of Moses the children of Israel worshipped a calf’s head.’'
And Jerome, on Hos. vii. “ They made a calf⁷s head in the wilder-
ness.” And on Amos v. “They formed the gold into the shape
of a calf's head.'’ And Augustine, in Ps. lxi. “A calf’s head
was the body of the wicked.’' And Isidorus, Orig. lib. viii. cap.
xi. where, speaking of the Egyptian Apis, “The Jews made the
image of this head to themselves in the wildernessss’ And the
sentence of the fathers of the seventh synod about the use
of images, “ WVhen they inconsiderately made a calf’s head.’'
And Eutychius of Alexandria21 ‘⁶ They took their wives’ orna-
ments, and melted them, and there came forth out of them a
calf’s head.'’ Which will excite the reader’s admiration, seeing,
if I mistake not, in ten several places of the scripture it is said,

¹ Lib. iv. cap. 10. ² nist. lib. i. p. 106.
