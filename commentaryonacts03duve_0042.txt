22 THE Ac'rs or THE HoLY APOSTLES [onst. 1·

from precept. Here is Mount· Sion, which in the Hebrew lan-
guage signifies a watch-tower, from whence all earthly things are
looked on with disdain. Neither does it make against where it is
said that the wind filled the house, and not the temple. For it is
known that the temple of Solomon was called the first house, and
the temple of Zerubbabel the second house. To all this we may add
that noted place : Ami I will fill this house with ylory. The ylory of
the latter house shall be yreater than qs tlte former, Hag. ii. 7, 9. Which
prophecy was fulfilled upon the feast of Pentecost, when the Holy
spirit, with which the first temple was adorned, but of which the
second temple was deprived, according to the confession of the
Hebrews, as also of the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the perpetual
fire, and the typical presence of the Divine Majesty, filled that
temple with the sacred blast, and the apostles with those gifts‚
which struck all nations into admiration. So that from that time
the Holy Spirit alone supplied the absence of the ark, the Urim
and Thummim, and the perpetual fire3 and, converting type into
verity, granted to us the majesty of God everywhere present with
his church.”

Abode. In the Greek, ‘⁶ were remaining‚” or “did remain to-
gether‚'’

Peter, &c. See our explication upon Matt. x. 2, 3.

JameS. Supply, ‘⁶ the son of Alpheus.” This Alpheus is thought
to be called Cleophas, or Cleopas. For that she who is called
Mary the mother of J ames the lesser, and Joses, is called Mai-y
the wife of Cleopas, or Cleophas, Luke xxiv. 18; Mark xv. 403
John xix. 25.

And Judas. Supply, “the brother of James,” as he calls himself
in his own Epistle General. This person, that he might be the
more truly distinguished from J udas Iscariot, the son of Simon, is
by St. Matthew surnamed Thaddeus3 and from Lebba, a sea town
of Galilee, of which Pliny¹ makes mention, called also Lebbeus, as
Lightfoot conjectures in his Hebraic Hours upon Matr. x. 33 John
xii. 4. Although in the Hackian edition of Pliny, in the place cited
by Lightfoot, the town is not called Lebba, but Jcbba.

14. These all continued with one accord in prayer. This St. Luke
expresses by other words in his Gospel, ch. xxiv. 53: And they
were continual& in tlte temple, praisz'nfs and blessz‘rzf] God. The words,
with one accord, denote, that they did not only agree with hearts
