Abraham, after he had dwelt ten years in Canaan, took Hagar to
wife, of whom in the eighty-sixth year of his age he begot his son
Ishmael, Gen. xvi. 15, 16, it appears that he went directly from
Mesopotamia to canaan, and that he nowhere fixed any settled
habitation till he came to Canaan. Moreover, whether he had
obtained that kingdom by force or entreaty, he would not so soon
have deserted it, especially when he was constrained by famine to
undertake a journey to Egypt3 nor would the sacred writers have
neglected to give some hints of a passage so considerable, and
which would have tended so much to the glory of the Jews.

5. And lte fflzve lzz‘m not, &c. Stephen proposes two things here
to be considered in Abraham, whereby God did mightily exercise
his saith. First, That he transported him into Canaan, which the
Jews now inhabit, and yet gave him no possession, not so much as
a foot-breadth. Secondly, That 116 promised to give this land to
him and his seed, when as yet he had no seed.

6. And Gocl spake, &c. As if 116 had said, But God foretold to
Abraham, seized with a deep sleep and fear, Gen. xv„ that his
seed should be a stranger in α land that is not tlzeirs ,· that is, in a
strange land, and should be in bondage and affliction there four
hundred years. That these four hundred years are to be com-
puted from the hundredth year of Abraham in the which he
begat Isaac, or the hundred and fifth year in which a separation
was made of Abraham’s seed, and an appointing of Isaac heir,
Ishmael being banished, Gen. xxi„ is beyond all question3 for in
this prophecy (in which he appointeth four hundred years for the
wandering, affliction, and bondage of his posterity) God maketh
express mention of the seed that should wander, be afflicted, and
in bondage3 and therefore these four hundred years cannot be
thought to have had a being, before that seed was appointed or
actually differenced and determined. But the time from Abra-
ham’s removing into Canaan to the year of the Israelites’ departure
from Egypt is computed to be four hundred and thirty years,
Hence Paul, Gal. iii. 17, plainly reckoneth four hundred and
thirty years from the promise made to Abraham, Gen. xii„ when
he was about to depart from his native country, to the publishing of
the law which was on the third month after the children of Israel’s
departure out of Egypt. ‘⁶ The years of the pilgrimage of the
children of Israel,'’ saith Heidegger, “are described by Moses,
Exod. xii. 40, 31151731, And the sqy‘ozcrniny of the children of Israel,
