nacle, because that was the most ancient habitation. The sense of
this verse is, as if he should say, The kingdom of David, first
divided by the cutting off of ten tribes and afterwards wholly de-
eayed, I will restore, so as that it shall again flourish, as in the
past times of David and Solomon. This prophecy was first, andin the
grosser sense, fulfilled in Zerubba-bel, a type of Christ, but was per-
fectly aecomplished in Christ himself, (and shall be yet more fully,)
when of all the tribes of Israel many submitted, and shall unto
the end of the world submit, and adhere unto him, the Son of David,
and aeknowledge his sovereignty, shadowed by David’s throne.

David shall be restored to so great splendour, that besides the people
of Israel heretofore subject to it, the rest of the nations shall submit
thereunto, and be numbered amongst the people of God. This in
the literal and typica] sense was made good when the Maccabeos
subjected to themselves great numbers of the Ishmaelites, Am-
monites, and Moabites, and when Hyrcanus subdued the Edom-
ites.¹ But in the mystie sense, intended by the Holy Ghost
speaking by the mouth of Amos, it is fulfilled in the conversion of
the Gentiles to Christ; that they, together with the Jews embracing
Christianity, may sincerely and religiously worship him, and live
according to his requirements. This verse is often expounded of
the call of the Gentiles in Bereschith Rabbah, Sect. 88.

Seek. In the Hebrew text of Amos it is, Jirshoa ‘⁶ might
possess,'’ for which the Seventy read, Jidreslzou “might seek;”
unless perhaps they took the verb of “possessing‚” for the study
and endeavour of possessing, as it is taken, Deut. ii. 24, 31.

Ths rest of men. The Hebrew text of Amos is wont to be trans-
lated, “the rest of Edom;” but the Seventy took the Hebrew particle
eth, which for the most part is set before the accusative, to be here
a note of the nominative ease, as it is used, l Sam. xvii. 343
2 Kings vi. 53 ix. 25; Neh. ix. 32, 343 Jer. xxxiii. 53 xxxviii.
163 Ezek. xxxix. 14. ‘⁶ And for Edom they seem to have read
Adam, or rather,” says the famous Ludovicus De Dieu, “ as often
elsewhere, so here they might think Edom to be taken in a larger
sense than for the people properly so called3 for as of the two sons
of Rebecca, ‚Jacob represented the church, so the elder son, viz„
Esau or Edom, shadowed out all the rest of mankind that were
aliens from the church3 for which reason in the writings of the
