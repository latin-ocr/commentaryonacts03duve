Cassian it is called Quinquagesima3 ¹ by Rabanus, and ² Honorius
of Augustodunum, Quinquagesima, Pasehalis, to distinguish it
from the other Quinquagesima, which is before the Quadragesima,
Lent. The sense, therefore, of Luke is the same as if he had
said, When the day came, or presently after it was past, wherein
the paschal Quinquagesima was completed. For the words of
Luke admit either of the two interpretations, 115 1116 1111116 observed
in our annotations upon Matt. xxi. 1.

They were all. That is, those hundred and twenty, of which
that most noble and most 116111 college of disciples of Christ at
that time consisted3 115 15 511111 before, 611. 1. 15.

With one accord. The Greek word 15 rendered by Bcza ‘⁴ with
one accord,” as in the English3 but by 1116 Latin Vulgate inter-
preter here, “together:” above, ch. i. 14, “unanimously.'’ Never-
11161655, we must confess, that the sels—same word is often made use
of by 1116 Greek interpreters of the scripture to express the simple
meaning of the word toyether, even where there cannot be any
agreement of mind·
⁰ In the same place. That 15, in the same (lining-room or upper
chamber, into which the disciples ascended upon their return from
Mount Olivet 16 Jerusalem. See what we have said upon the
same 1111166, 611. i. 13.

2. And there came. That 15, upon the first day of the week, 1116
fiftieth from the resurrection of Christ, and the tenth from his
ascent into heaven, which that year, according 16 Usher's Chro-
nology, fell upon the 24th of May. This day by the Christians
is called, from the Greek word, Pe22teeost; but by the first
Council of Orleans, and by the second of Tours, chz‘nqzcayesz‘ma.³

Suddenly. The ears are the more surprised with a sudden and
unexpected 116156.

Α sound from heaven. In Greek, “a sound reverberated, or
resounding.” As if he had said, The sky by the divine power
resounded with a sudden noise, 115 if a violent wind had suddenly
begun to blow with unusual violence. But as the four evangelists
neither of them say that a dove desc-ended upon Christ at 1115
baptism ; so it 15 1161 here said, that there was heard the sound of
a vehement wind, but “as it were of a vehement wind.⁷' In the
