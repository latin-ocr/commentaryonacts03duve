which unless thou repent,*shall surely befall thee3 seeing that thou
dost so contemptuously undervalue the Spirit of God, that thou
wouldest set to wicked sale his inestimable gift, given freely unto
us to illustrate the glory of Christ by our ministry. Bede, and
the common gloss have observed, that the words of Peter are not
so much a curse as a threateuing, or threatening prediction3 but
that it is conditionally to be understood in respect of the person
of Simon, is made manifest below, ver. 22.

21. Thou lzast, &c. As if he should say, For neither as thou art
now disposed, canst thou be either partaker or sharer of that eternal
life which we do preach. Peter gives an account why he thundered

and by crooked windings or backgoings, to have turned from the
sincerity of the gospel.

22. Repent therefore, διο. As if he should have said, If there—
