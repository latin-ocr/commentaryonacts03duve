Ἶᾙζξ, that sojourned in qupt, continued four hundred and thirty
years. On which place Dr. Usher, Bishop of Armagh,¹ learnedly
observes three things especially. First, “ That the word 1122'572,
as generally it denotes any habitation, so when it is referred to
foreigners and strangers it signifies a pilgrimage. Hence with the
Hebrews 3ᾙῆῑῆ denoteth a sojourner and pilgrim: and Abraham
himself, Gen. xxiii. 4, saith that he was ΞῺρῆΠ-Ἶὲ α strmzyer and
pz‘lyrinw. And Gen. xxi. 34, instead of *1231 the Chaldee has
:imi-u. And ch. xxviii. 4, instead of ἾἭῙῼ γ’ζῑζςἛῇζ the same has
ἾΠἮι-ιπη >³wa tr. Secondly, That the land of Canaan, as it was
accounted the land of the sojourning of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
so also of the Israelites that, descended from them, to wit, by
reason of that strict tie of kin that is betwixt forefathers and their
posterity. And truly God had promised to those three patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give them this land of
their pilgrimage, to be by them heritably possessed, Ps. cv. 11,
which afterwards was accomplished in their posterit-y. As there-
fore the possession of the posterity is attributed to the forefitthers3
so also the pilgrimage of the forefathers is attributed to this
posterity. Instances of this you may, see Ps. lxvi. 63 Hos.
xii. 43 Amos v. 253 Judg. x. 11, 123 Acts vii. 42. Thirdly,
That seeing the Hebrews have no cases, the pronoun ἾὈξΝ here has
an ambiguous reference. Hence it is that the Vulgate Latin
edition, the Polyglott Bibles, the Royal of Antwerp, and the
Jayan of Paris, read in this place: “But the dwelling of the
children of Israel, who sojourned in Egypt, was for four hundred
and thirty years.’⁷ Whereas other copies of the same edition
have: “The dwelling of the children of Israel, whereby they
abode in Egypt.” To which latter acceptation of the relative
pronoun determining the chronography, seeing it attributes four
hundred and thirty years to the sojourning of the children of Israel
in Egypt, which was a shorter time by half, the former is alte-
gether to be preferred, which removes that inconvenience, and
g1ves us only a prosopography, or a description of them whose
entire pilgrimage, beginning at the sevcnty-sixth year of Abra-
ham’s age, is continued thence to the going forth out of Egypt for
the space of four hundred years. But the reason why hloscs
takes that description of the Israelites from their sojourning in
Egypt, was, because that pilgrimage of the patriarchs was both
