in the English version, that is, having loosed the bands of the
sepulchre, or, which is the same thing, having broken the strong
cords of death with which Christ had surrendered himself to be
bound, laying down his soul that he might re-assume it, John x. 173
alluding to the swathings of the dead, or to the cords with which
malefactors are bound when led to execution, to prevent their crafty
means to escape. From these bands God set Christ at liberty,
recalling him to a life never to be ended. ‘⁶ The Hebrew word
dahel? saith Sir Edward Leigh,2 “signifies two things, a cord or
a fetter, or the torments or pangs, more especially of a child-bearing
woman. Hence this word occurring to the scventy interpreters,
where it certainly signifies cords or bonds, Ps. xviii. 5, see margin,

might resume it, John x. 17, 18.

held and bound, he was free to break the eords. For hell in this
verse is taken either for the grave, or for the common receptacle
of all souls separated by death from the body3 which most of the
ancient interpretem, both ‚Jews and Christians, believe to be
signified in scripture by the word hell. Hence that of Hilarius,³
“ This is the law of human necessity: that the bodies being buried,
the souls descend to hell, which descent, to the full finishing of all
that belonged to a true man, the Lord himself did not refuse.’'

souls, the Hebrews call Sheol; the Greeks Hades, and both divide
