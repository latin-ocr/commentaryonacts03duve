J esus, J olm vii. 17: If any man will do his will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be qf God, or whether I speah qs myself}
meaning that he who desirest to be certain of the truth of religion,
ought first to be possessed with an ardent desire to do the will of
God, and that then God would not suffer him to be tossed with
doubtings, but would reveal to* him what he ought to follow in
order to his salvation. Yet it cannot be said for certain that Lydia
alone believed Paul's preaching, for that Luke’s making mention
of her only seems only to tend to show what moved Paul with
his company to go to her house.

That she actended to the thinys that were spoken of Paul. Calvin
saith excellently: “The manner of speaking is to be noted, that
Lydia's heart was opened, that she might attend to the words of
an exte1·nalte·acher; for as preaching alone is nothing else but a
dead letter, so upon the other hand we are to take heed that no
false imaginatiom nor the likeness of any secret revelation take us
off from the word, whence our faith depends, and in which it
resteth. For* many that they may enlarge the grace of the Spirit,
devise I know not what enthusiasms to themselves, that there may
be no use for the external word3 but the scripture allows not such a

Luke, that we can profit nothing by the bare hearing of the
word without the grace of the Spirit, and that the Spirit is con-
ferred on us, not to beget contempt of the word, but rather to
instil the saith of it in our minds, and write it in our hearts.''

15. And when she was baptized. Calvin saith notably: “ Hence
it appears how effectually God in a little moment of time wrought
upon Lydia’s heart3 for it is not to be doubted but she truly
embraced the saith of Christ, and gave up her name to him before
she was admitted to baptism by Paul.’'

And her household. That is, and her domestics, who believed
the preaching of the gospel, were baptized also. “Lydia,’' saith
Calvin, “had not the hearts of all her family in her hand, so as
at her pleasure to convert whom she would to Christ3 but the
