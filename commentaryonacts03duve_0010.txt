friends. The result was naturally that he should be admitted into the
orders of the English chureh3 and he was appointed chaplain and tutor in

a noble family.

In a revised edition of a Commentary 011 Matthew and Mark, published
in A.D. 1670, he furnishes some account of the alterations he had made,
and of himself. This work hadissued from the press six years previously,
and contained a very literal explanation of the words, which was conform-
able to his usual method. In composing it, he states that he availed
himself both of what he had found in searching into the monuments of
antiquity, as transmitted to us by the fathers, and of what he had himself
observed during a careful examination of ancient and modern writers. The
Hebrew rites and the idioms of the language‚ among which, he emphati-
cally remarks, he was born, instruam, and brouqht up, afforded no small
degree of light, in aid of his explanations. At that time he was a public
teacher of pivinity in the University of Anjou, and was therefore induced,
probably with a particular view to his immediate pupils, to intersperse 111
his Commentary several dissertations on the Divine doctrine and history
of the Christian religion. These abounded with defences of the superu
stitione and erroneous dogmas of the Romish church, and “ therefore‚'' says
he, “since God has delivered me from that dismal darkness out of his
abundant mercy, it is fitting that I should use the greatest diligence to
have this my Commentary reprinted, that I may therein publicly oppose
the errors which I have defended ; and here and there briefly explain the
weighty reasons which God employed to dispel the darkness of my mind.”
He further proceeds to inform the reader that he had made considerable
alterations even where the controversy was not concerned, so as almost to
make a new book, as well as a new edition. What he means by intimating
that “ now, whatever writers he quoted, he quoted truly‚'' we are at some
loss to divine. Are we to understand that he had formerly, under the
influence of papistical prejudice, and Jesuitical contiivance, to enforce an
error, willingly perverted the words of scripture, by distorting and falsifying
learned authorities i> If 80, it is a sad suieidal charge, yet not without its
sanction by even eminent names in the annals of those bitter religious
controversies which agitated former times. These culpable perversione
have, alas! too often evinced that passion has for a season over-mastered
principle, in ecclesiastical conflicts3 but they are now, we have reason to

believe, of very rare occurrence.

Solomon's Song,'' dedicating it, according to the fashion of the age, to Sir
