they should not many years enjoy. And the occasion was now fit,
at the first preaching of the gospel and gathering up a church to
Christ, to furnish the apostles and others for this service and
employment. And therefore, when the gospel was also spread
among the Gentiles, the apostles were so careful to make collec-
tions in the churches for the relief of the poor saints in Jerusalem,
even those who at the first had disfurnished themselves of all, and
at whose charge, as may be supposed, the gospel was at the begin-
