“If Annas was vicar to Caiaphas, as Bullinger will have it,
how comes it to pass that by the evangelists Annas is always
set before Caiaphas? In the 2 Chron. xxxi. 12, the ruler over
the treasury of the sanctuary is called nayz'd, ruler, Cononiah, and
Shimei his brother the next. Were it proper 'there that Shimei
should be called παρή and be set before Cononiah?

‘⁶ If Annas were called high priest, because he had formerly
officiated in that dignity, how comes it to pass, that among so
many others, who had borne the same office, only Annas should
be mentioned? How eomes it to pass, that he that had been high
priest should be always set before him that is yet high priest?
These expontifices were indeed called pontiffs for honour's sake,
but never any public acts were marked with their names.

“ Therefore, here, I prefer far Baronius before Casaubon, Sca-
liger, or Bullinger either, who asserts Annas to be called high
priest because he was president of the great Sanhedrim, which
by the Hebrews was called nasi. And the person next to him
was called, The father of the house of justice. These two chiefs
of the Sanhedrim were both styled priests, because they were over
many priests. Hence, if I niistake not, we read that the sons of
David were priests, 2 Sam. viii. 183 that is, according to the Chal-
dee paraphrast, grandees3 and, indeed, they were grandees, be-
cause both David’s sons were presidents or princes of the great
Smhedrimff’ Thus far Blondel, which will be inore plain out of the
following words of Selden :—

⁵⁶ We are to understand,'’ saith he, “ that those titles of high or
chief priests, which denote a certain function or dignity in the
form of the Jewish govermnent at that time much iinpaired,
denoted either a sacred function, or civil dignity, which the high-
priest enjeyed above the rest. WVhere mention is made together
of the high-priest, and of the sacred function proper to the dignity,
there that very person is signified who obtained the peculial·
dignity, that is, the high priesthood derived together with the
sacred funetion from Aaron. But where mention is made not at
all of the sacred function, but altogether of the civil governrnent
of the high-priests, that is, as they governed with an authority
limited by the Romans,—as in many places of the gospel, and of the
Acts of the Apostles—there it seems very probable that the
high priests are designed by that title, not as they were advanced
to the sac-red dignity, but as they presided in the civil administra-
