For 30 z‘s his name by interpretation. Which in ver. 6, is Bar-
jesus3 therefore Elymas is not the Arabio name 1:⁵52> rendered
“sorcerer,'’ and which agrees to all such as are given to magio,
seeing the Syriae, Arabic, and Ethiopic translation do not begin
the word Elymas with y ain, but with Ν aleplz,· but it is an inter-
pretation of this sorcerer Barjesus's name, as the text saith, and
the Syrian interpreter confirms. See what we have just now
cited of Ludovicus de Dieu.

turned aside Sergius Paulus, the vice-praetor, from receiving the

for his twofold relation, his Hebrew name Saul, because he was an
Hebrew by birth3 his Roman name Paul, because he had the
freedom of a Roman. “Under the same notion,” saith famous
Lightfoot, ‘⁶ Silas is also called Silvanus, for he also was a Roman,
as may be gathered from Acts xvi. 37. The same upon 1 Cor.
i. 1. It was co1nmon,'’ saith he, ‘⁶ for them in the Jewish nation

that by which they who are not Jews called him ς’ and that of
the Jerusolymitan Tahnud, in the treatise called Gittin, folio
xliii. 2 : ⁶ The Israelites without the land of Israel have the same

treatise‚ folio xlv. 3, of the Jews also living in the land of Israel:
‘Perhaps one of them hath two wives, one living in Judea, the

J udea, another in Galilee: if he subscribe his name by which he
is called in Judea, to send her who is in Galilee away, 01· subscribe
his name, by which he is called in Gafflee, to put her away, that
is, in Judea, it is no divorce.’ It is no wonder, therefore, if Saul,
who was born out of the land of Israel, and was a Roman, should
