tetic philosopher is the chief, who among other things did write a
universal history of eighty books according to Suidas, a hundred
and twenty-four according to J osephus, a hundred and forty-four
according to Athenaeus,¹ of which a few fragments are remaining.
He was very familiar with Herod the Great, also very much beloved
of Augustus Caesar, so that after him he called either dates nicolai,
as it is in Athenaeus3 Plutarch, symposiaccm ,· Pliny, Isiodore in
his Glosses, adhelmus: or a kind of cake, according to Serenus
Sammonicus, Hesychius, Milesius, Photius, and Suidas.‘·’ J oannes
DamascenUS, was of this city, who of a J ew became a Christian,
in the year of our Lord 46] 3 and another John, surnamed Manzur,
whom Suidas extols to the skies, the Greeks being very prodigal
in their own praise. “Although indeed,⁷’ saith Vossius,³ ‘⁶ Dama-
scenus was a most learned man, and of great fame, yet in many
things he was over credulous. His histories, related in his sermonS,
show this. Baronius doth truly aeknowledge that his writings are
of very uncertain credit, and that he abounds with many fictions3
which opinion of his Casuabon confirms,4 where he remarked many
gross errors. In others of his writings he does not appear judicious3
as, for example's sake, when he tells us of Falconillaes’ soul, that
she, by the prayers of St. Thecla, the first martyr, was delivered
from the punishments of hell, although she died in the heathen's
errors and idolatry. Likewise where he saith, that the soul of the
Emperor Trajan was exempted from infernal punishments, by the
prayers of Gregory the Great. Both which you may read in
Damascenus, in his oration of those who died in the faith.” This
man was a great defendet of images against ¹the emperor Leo
Isaurus, and his son Constantine, the fifth of that name, surnamed
Copronymus 3 in a synod of three hundred and thirty-eight bishops,
convocated by the same Constantine, held at Constantinople, A.D.
754, which also was called the seventh oecumenic synod, he with
Germanus and George, sometimes patriarchs of Constantinople,
was condemned as an idolater and worshipper of wood and images,
as appears from the acts of that synod, which are inserted in the
sixth acts of the second synod of Nice. Amongst his own he was
called Chrysorrhoas, for his eloquence. He died A.D. 760. The

Damacene prunes are also famous, which were went to be carried
