Ι believe that Jeszcs Christis the Son qs God. As if he should
have said, I unfeignedly believe from my soul and beart that J esus
Christ is the only begotten Son of the eternal God, the Redeemer,
and Doctor of the world, promised in the law and prophetS, who
reconciled the Eternal F ather to us by the sacrifice of his death,
and swallowcd up by the shining of his gospel these sparks which
did glister in the Old Testament, that whoever should hear him,v
and should lead his life up unto the rule delivered by him, should
obtain eterna] salvation by his intercession and merits. Hence it
is manifest, that to be baptized in the name, or unto the name of
J esus Christ, is no other thing than to be baptized upon profession
of saith in Christ, without hypocrisy, and upon promise that he
doth embrace the doctrine revealed by him in the scriptures, with
an carnest desire of heart, and will reform and correct his manners
according to it.

Luther in his Latin tom. i.‚ printed at WVittenburg, fol. 71, con-
cerning the sacrament of baptism : “ The name ‘baptism’ is a Greek
word, it may be turned a dipping, when we clip something in water,
that it may be wholly covered with water3 and although that
custom be now altogether abolished among the most part, for
neither do they dip the whole children, but only sprinkle them
with a little water, they ought altogether nevertlieless to be
dipped, and presently to be drawn out again. For the etymology
of the word seems to require that. And the Germans also call
baptism tazff from deepness, which they call tl'ejff in their tongue,
as if it were meet that those be dipped deeply, who are baptized.
And truly if ye consider what baptism doth signify, ye shall see
the same thing to be required3 for it signifieth this, that the
old man and our nativity, that is full of sins, which is wholly of
flesh and blood, may be overwhclmed by the divine grace: there-
