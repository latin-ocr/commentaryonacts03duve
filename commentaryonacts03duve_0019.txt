A Letter from the Emiozent and lem-md Monsieur Claude, co the Author.

Monsieur,

Ι received your Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles, you were pleased
to send me, and give you a thousand thanks for this share you are so kind as to
afford me in your remembrance ; which Ι have entertained not only with all
due acknowledgment, but also with much joy, as coming from a person who is
and ever shall be very dear to me, and for whom Ι have a most peculial· esteem.
I have redused your Commentary‚ though it came but very lately to my hands,
and have found therein, as in all your other works, the marks of a copious
reading, abundance of sense, right reason, and just and exact understanding,
and 1 do not doubt but that this Commentary will be kindly received by the
learned and prove very useful to all those who apply themselves to understand
the Scripture. This shows you, Monsieur, not idle, and that you manage well
the talents God has been pleased to bestow upon you. The public will be very
much obliged to you, if you continue (as Ι hope you will, and which I take the
freedom to exhort you to) making it such like presente. For my own part Ι
find therein a very great edificaffion, aud wish with all my heart it lay in my
power to manifest it to you by effectual services. I beseech you to be per-
suaded of this truth, and that you would preserve me the honour of your
friendship, which Ι shall ever look upon as very much to my advantage. I
take my leave, praying God he would continue to pour upon you his holy
benedictione, and assuring you that Ι am,

Monsieur,
Your most humhle and most obedient servant,
Omunn.

Such is the depth of the Christian Scripture, that therein Ι could reap new
advantage every day, if Ι had given myself over to the study of it alone, from
my very first childhood even to decrepit old age, with the greatest leisure

to the knowledge of those things that are necessary to salvation; but after
