signification it is also taken intransitively, as in Plato de Repub„
lib. vi., according to the interpretation of Budaeus, and so the
Greek word may here be fitly rendered: ‘ consenting, unanimously

To Samothracia. Samothracia is an island in the AEgean sea, bor-
dering upon Thrace, not far from the mouth of the river Hebrus,
with a city of the same name. The Latius frequently call it
Samothracia, as Virgil, AEneid vii. 207.

This island was before called Dardania, from Dardanus the son
of Jupiter, begotten by Electra3 who, because of his brother J asius
whom he had killed, fied thither from Italy. It was also called
Leucadia, because it appears whitish to the spectators afar off.
Afterwards Thracia, from the Thracians which inhabited it. And
lastly, it was called Samothracia, because that after the Thracians
the Samians dwelt therein. Pliny saith,¹ that this island was the
fullest of commodious harbours of any of the rest, and is raised up
upon the mountain Saoce, wherefore it was also called Saocis,
saith Hesychius.2 Strabo saith likewise, it was called Melite
and Samos3 but at this day it is commonly called Samadrachi.
The Sacrifices of the Samothracians were most famous amongst
the Ethnics of old, the ceremouies of which Pliny calleth most
holy;3 therefore Germanicus in Tacitus was taken with desire of
seeing the sacrifices of the Samothracians, but the north wiuds
crossing him made him change his purpose.4 The Samothracians
were called the kinsmen of the Romans, because Dardanus carried
away the household gods from Italy to Samothrace, and from thence
to Phrygia3 which afterwards AEneas carried back from Troy to
Italy, saith Servius.⁵ The Samothracian rings were likewise
famous, which were either all iron but overgilded, 01· gold, but
with a little iron head, that the iron might be instead of the jewel,
as may be seen in Pliny.6 Hence those rings are called Samo-
thracia ferrea, by Lucretius, lib. 6. The ancients believed that
those Samothraciam rings had some preservative virtue3 as also the
natural rings of the Greeks, which were hollow and void within,
as Artemidorus writes. In the ceremonies of the priest of Jupiter,
