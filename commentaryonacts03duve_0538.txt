writing, and Aristarchus the Macedonian of the city Thessalonica,
who is mentioned in the immediately following verse.

And to delz'ver Paul. That is, and that Paul should be delivered.

what we have said of Italy, above, ch. xviii. 2.

With other prisoner& That is, with some others who were kept
in custody, and by reason of the intricacy of their cause that were
