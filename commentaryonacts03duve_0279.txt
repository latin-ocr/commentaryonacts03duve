vnn. xxxva] LITERALLY ExPLAINEn. 259

that saying of God in Isa. lvi. 1, Thus saith the Lord, Keep με
judyment, and do justice, for my salvation is near to come, and my
rz’ylzteousness to be revealed. The peace or salvation which was at
hand by J esus Christ, is there deelared, but at the same time the
word is sent, that is, the command to the children of Israel, that
they should work justice. And so the children of Israel themselves
are taught, that those only are truly accepted of God, and even
all those, who study righteousness'. Because there straight is
added, Blessed is tlze man that dotlz this, and tlze son of man that
loyetlz hold on it, whosoever he be, whether J ew or Gentile, with-
out any respect of persons. And so he truly says, that that which
he had said in the 35th verse is the sels-same speech which God
had long before sent to the children of Israel, when he declared
peace by J esus Christ, who was to come.'’

He is Lord of all. That is, neither is Christ the Lord of one,
but of all nations. Moses was the minister of the law, and that to
the Jews alone: but Christ is the power of God to give salvation to
every one that believeth, to the J ew first and then to the Greek,
Rom. i. 16. Hither pertains what Paul says, Rom. iii. 29, Is lte
tlte God of tlze Jews only ? Is lle not also of the Gentiles, &c., and
Eph. ii. 14: For lae is our peace, wlto lzatlz made both one, and ῘιατΙι
broken down the middle wall of parlitz'on between uS, διο. Hence
Luke ii. 14 3 at Christ's birth the angels declare peace on earth
to men3 at his resurrection all power both in heaven and earth
is given him, Matt. xxviii. 183 and a little before his departure
he commands his disciples that they should preach the gospel to
every creature, Mark xvi. 15.

37. Yon know, ἃς. As much as to say, you have heard by
fame and repert, that there is a rumour spread over all Judea,
which first began in Galilee, since that ‚John preached baptism,
thereby to stir people’s minds to the expectation of Christ.

For heyinniny. The causal particle is wanting in the Greek
text. And, indeed, deservedly, soritis referred to verbnm, “ the
word,” which here is put for the fame or repert of J esus, which
report is said to have begun in Galilee.

38. Jesus of Galz'lee, how Gocl anointecl him. The particle ὦς,
how, is transposed, as Rom. xii. 3, and the relative, αὐτὸν, him, is
redundant after the manner of the Hebrews. “But as for the
word anointing,'’ saith Beza, “it is derived from the custom of
the JeWS‚ whose kings, prophets, and priests used to be anointed.
