VER. xxxva] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 125

In the days qf the taxiny. That is, while Publius Sulpitius
Quirinius, or Cyrenius, taxed Judea. Scaliger (saith Valesius)
saith,¹ “That Luke speaks not here of the first taxing, under
which Christ was born, but of the second, which was made after
Archelaus’s banishment3 and sharply reproves Eusebius for con-
founding these two taxings among themselves. But Scaliger
himself is very greatly mistaken3 who being seconded by no
author, would obtrude two taxings upon 115, while both Josephus
and Luke himself avouch there was but one. For Luke saith not
qf tlze second taxz‘ny, but only of tlte tax-inq.- intimating that there
was but one taxing. Origen also, in his first book against Celsus,
agreeth with Eusebius, in these words: ⁶ After him, in the days of
the taxing, at which time J esus was born, J udas a certain Gali-
lean made many of the people to revolt to him? Therefore
Scaliger’s censure must attaint Origen, for he affirmed the same
that Eusebius did. For Origen distinguished not two taxings of
Judea. Moreover‚ Eusebius agreeth very well with himself, for
that having followed evangelie authority, 116 made that taxing of
Quirinius to fall about the birth of Christ, it follows that he
should apply the insurrection of J udas the Galilean to the same
time, wherein, indeed, 116 differs from Josephus, but agrecth
exceeding well with Luke and with himself,³ If so be that any
will choose to embrace our opinion, there shall no difference be
found between Luke and Josephus. For we say that the taxing
at the time Christ was born, began when Herod reigned in ,Judea‚
and that it was ended by Quirinius, when Archelaus, Herod's son,
was banished. In which very time we say that Judas's insur-
rection fell out 111 Judea, to wit, after Archelaus’s banishment.
Surely, before Archelaus's being deposed, there was no ground
why J udas should stir up the people to 1’cvolt3 for that the
Roman magistrate would not tax there, where the king was a
friend, and an ally of the people of Rome 3 neither were the Jews 111
any hazard of being slaves to foreigners, while they had a king of
their nation and religion. ἶ1111161166 11 appears, that the taxing
and insurrection of J udas the Galilean, could not fall out 1111 after
Archelaus’s banishment.'’ Thus far Valesius in his notes upon
Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History, book i. 611.5.

The same Valesius, in the same place a little before: “ Joseplms‚”
saith he, “does indeed mention the taxing made by Quirinius in Syria
