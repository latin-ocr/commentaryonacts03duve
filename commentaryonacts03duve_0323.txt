VER. xum] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 303

47. For so Izatla tlte Lord commanded us· Above, ch. i. 83 Matt.
xxviii. 19; Mark xvi. 153 Luke xxiv. 47 3 and that to this Saul or
Paul there was a command given by Christ concerning his embas-
sage, which he was to undertake for Christ to foreign nations, to
preach to them the gospel, appears below, ch. xxii. 213 xxvi. 17,
18; Gal. i. 163 ii. 8.

I leave set, &c. As much as to say, For what is spoken of
Isaiah, as Christ’s type in some measure, Isa. xlii. 6, is truly ful-
filled in Christ the Lord, whom he did shadow. For the virtue of
Christ shall in no case be restricted to the people of Israel only,
but as the words of God found in Isaiah, his light will send forth
its beams to the far ends of the earth, by the preaching of his dis—
ciples, for the salvation of such, who of any nation in any part of
the earth shall believe in him.

48. And when tlte Gentiles heard tlzz's. Pisidians by birth, aliens
from the people of Israel, that salvation was promised to them
many ages before, by the coming of Christ.

They were qlod. That it was at length fulfilled, which was fore-
told so many ag es before

And yloy‘g'fied the word (ff tlte Lord. That is, they praised the
goodness of God, which shined forth in the gospel, preaehed to
them by Paul and Barnabas.

And as many as were ordainecl to eternal lffie. That is, as many
as were candidates of etei-nal life, as Mede excellently expounds it,
Sermon iii. in Acts xvii. 4, or as many as were sineerely and
honestly disposed to perform whatever God requires of men to
give them eternal life. The verb τάττο, is used of an army, and
placing of soldierS, of the registoring them in order or rank. Hence
the books that treat of ordering and drawing up an army are called
taetics. And so may Luke's words be rendered here, as Mede
excellently notes in the foreeited place. “As many as had given
up their names to eternal life, believed: or by an ellipsis of a par-
ticiple, who were of the band and company of such as hoped, and
earnestly endeavoured ‘so attain eternal life; otherwise, as many
as were in readiness for eternal life3 finally, and most conveniently‚
if it be taken in a military sense, and not of destination or
appointment, as many as were ordained to eternal life.”

49. The word qf tlte Lord. That is, the gospel of Christ

preaehed by Paul and Barnabas at Antioeh, the metropolis of
Pisidia.
