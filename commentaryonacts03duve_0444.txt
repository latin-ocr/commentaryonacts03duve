Sozomen saith,l “which is called the Lord’s day, which 1116 Hebrews
called the first day of the week, but the Greeks dedicated it to the
sun.'’ See what I have noted upon Matt. xxviii. 1. The table of
the canons lately published by the famous ,John Baptist 00161611116εΞ
“ It was not, before Christ's resurrection, called the Lord's day, but
the first day3 but after the resurrection it was called the Lord's
day, the lady of all days and festivities.'' We have the name of
the Lord's day in Rev. i. 10. In Ignatius⁷s epistle to the Tral-
lians and Magnesians, and sometimes in Clement’s Institutions, also
in that place of Irenaeus, which the writer of the answers to the
orthodox in J ustin Martyr hath preserved to us. The edict of
Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria: ‘⁶ Both custom and honesty
require of us that we should honour the Lord’s day, and celebrate
it, because Christ our Lord upon that day executed the eminent
office of his resurrection.’' Sedulius:³ ‘⁵ In the meantime after
that sad sabbath, the happy day began to dawn, which being most
welcome to the triumphing Lord, did take its name from his Majesty,
called for this honour the Lord’s day3 being a day that attained 10
the dignity to be the first that beheld the original of the rising
world, and the virtue of Christ rising again.’' St. Augustinez‘4
“ The Lord's day has been by Christ’s resurrection declared not to
the Jews but to the Christians, and from him it began to have its
festivity.” And, ⁵ “this day is called the Lord's day, because upon
this day the Lord rose again, or 10 teach by the very name of it,
that it ought to be wholly consecrated to the Lord.⁷' St. Maximus
Tau1·inensis:⁶‘ ‘⁶ The Lord’s day is therefore venerable and solemn
to 116, because upon it our Saviour, as the rising sun having driven
away the infernal darkness, shined with the light of his resurrection3
and therefore by the common speech of the world, it is called Sun-
day, because Christ the sun of righteousness being risen, did en-
lighten it.'’ The Roman order and Isidorez7 ‘⁶ The apostles there-
fore did with religious solemnity ratify the Lord's day, because
upon that day our Lord and Redeemer rose again from the dead;
and which also is called the Lord’s day, that in it, abstaining from
earthly works or worldly enticements, we should give ourselves only
10 divine worship, giving, to wit, honour and reverence to this day,
for the hope of our resurrection, which we have in him.'’ Gregorius
Turonensisz⁸ “This is the day of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
