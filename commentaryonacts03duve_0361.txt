VER. xx[x.] LITERALLY EXPLMNED. 34]

and savage pcople, living brutishly, do like dogs delight to lick up
blood, and like the wild beasts of the wilderness, abundantly
devour things strangled.'' Pacianus, Bishop of Barcelona in his
Exhortation to Repentance‚ tells us: “That it is the epitome of
the N ew Testament to abstain from idolothytes, blood, and what is
strangled, and that to do otherwise is a great sin.” See what we
cited out of Chrysostom before, ver. 21. In the Second Council
of Orleans, A.O. 536, Can. 19, 23, it was decreed: “ That Catholics
who revolt to the worship of idols, or that by unlawful presump-
tion, make bold to taste of meats consecrated to the honour
of idols, shall be repelled from the assemblies of the church3 as
also those who feed on anything that which being killed by the
biting of beasts or by any disease, or other chance is strangled.'’
Theodorus, (as some will have him) Archbishop of Canterbury, in
his Penitential: “Beasts that are Worried by wolves or dogs are
not to be eaten, unless by chance whilst they are yet alive they be

first killed bysolne man: but let them, as well as a hart or buck
that are found dead, be given to the dogs and swine: so likewise if
birds or other creatures be strangled in nets or gins, they are not
to be eaten, nor if an hawk have seized them and they are found
dead3 because in the Acts of the Apostles we are commanded to
abstain from fornication‚ blood, things strangled, and idolatry.
He that eateth any such flesh as either died alone, or killed by any
beast, let him do penance forty days.” In the Council of Rouen,
Anno 682, it was ordained, “that inquiry should be made, whether
any one had caten blood, or anything that died of itself, or was
worried to death by any beasts.'’ In the sixth general synod
(which was held A.D., 692, under Justinian the second emperor of
that name surnamed Rhinometus, at Constantinople, in a vaulted
apartment of the emperor’s palace‚ which apartmeut was called
Trullum, whence it is called Synodus ΤιίιΠῖιΠῑι)2 the sixty-seventh
canon runs thus: “ The holy scripture enjoins us, that we abstain
from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Justl'y
therefore we condemn those who by any art dress or prepare the
blood of any animal and so eat it: he that is guilty thereof, if he
be a clerk let him be degraded3 if a layman excommunicated.”

Bede, in his book of the Remedies of Sin, c. 14: ‘⁴ Whoever shall
unwittingly eat of anything that died of itself, let him repent
