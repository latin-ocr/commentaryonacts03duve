tioned to have fallen out in Saul’s reign, all which do abundantly
demonstrate that. there was more than two years’ space betwixt
Saul’s reign and David’s. And these things are thus far so debated,
as if that place in Samuel were esteemed entire and incorrupt in
the editions which are now extant. But now, indeed, we must
know, that the Hebrew copies show this place to be imperfect,
when betwixt the words Sclzanalz and Ben, they leave a void place3
for some of them have it thus written, Rea—schama Sclzaoul. It
is probable the numerical note is wanting, which expressed the
number of the years of Saul's age when he began to reign3 for
it is usual in these books of kings to insert the ages of the kings
and the time of their reign, in the beginning of the history of
their acts, as 2 Sam. ii. 10, where we read, thus written: Isk-
boslzeth, Savl's son, was fortps years old when lze bessam to rez'fsn
over Israel, and reiqned two years. Which same thing is done in
David and other kings. Hence some Greek copies, supplying the
number here, do write ι υἱὸς τριάκοντα ἐτῶν, “ son of thirty years?
Seeing, therefore, that the beginning of the verse here is judged
defective, what wonder is it that the like fault doth happen as
to the number in the latter part of it, which defines the time of
Saul’s reign, and that therefore, the number expressed by the
evangelistS, who might 'as yet see the place entire, did differ so
much from what is this day seen in our cepies‘? Especially seeing
that in the end of the sixth book of Josephus's Antiquities, Saul
is said to have reigned eight years while Samuel lived, and two
and twenty after his death3 which is a token that of old there
was another reading of this place extant, having the notes of the
numbers, though not so much differing.”

He raised up unte them David to be their kinq. That is, that
Jacob’s prophecy, Gen. xlix. 10, might be made good, he pro-
moted David, of the tribe of Judah, hitherto a mean and obscure
man, to the kingly dignity, who upon Saul’s death should succeed
in the kingdom. See the forecited places, and Ps. lxxvii. 70, 71 3
