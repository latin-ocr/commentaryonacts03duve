that was killed in Parnassus, doth allude. Yet Ephorus hath written
that it was not a dragon but a man3 from whom Strabo reports ¹ that
Apollo with arrows killed a fierce man named Python, surnamed
Draco, after that for a long time he had infested the inhabitants of
Parnassus with mut-ders and robberies, The same man, instead of
Python, is named Delphynes by Suidas after Apollonius.‘³ If I see
anything in this darkness, this man was a great robber in Phocis,
whose true name was Delphynesg Python was a surname given
him by the Phoenicians, who then inhabited the neighbouring
Boeotia, because of the tumults which he stirred up, and the rob-
beries he committed. Indeed, with the Arabians who have plne
instead of pe, ‘because they want the letter p, the word plzatlmna,
signifieth ⁶ to stir up tumults3 ' pleitlmrz, ⁶ sedition, slaughter3 ’
plzatlzczn, ‘seditious, a thief, or robber3’ but the same man is of a
robber made a dragon by the inventors of sables, because in Syriae
pitlmn or petlzen signifieth a dragon, and therefore is he also called
Python. From this Python were the Pythian plays, and the city of
the Delphs, Pytho or Pltytlzon, and Apollo himself calleci Python.
illacrobius saith,³ that the Greeks prattle that this name Python was
given to the god for killing the dragon, Therefore the spirit of 5
Python, Acts xvi. 16, is the spirit of Apollo, by which demon it was
believed that woman-conjuret· was possessed. Hence the very con—
jurors themselves, who were of old called Euryclea), are now called
Pytlzones, saith Plutarch, in his book of the Cessation of the Oracles.
In this sense the Hebrews, instead of Python, write Pythom, by a
small change of the word, and dream that those kind of soothsayers
did not speak out of the belly, but out of the armpits.'' See, pray,
Maimonides's Treatise concerning Idolatry, cap. vi.

By sootlesayiny. That is, by receiving the rewards of her seoth-
saying from those who consulted her concerning hidden matters,
as things stolen, the success of a journey, and the like. The
scholiast observeth upon Aristophanes: “That Eurycles did, as ·
speaking out of his belly, foretel true things to the Athenians by
the help of the demon which was in him. Hence all soothsayers
are called ventriloqui and Euryclitae, from Eurycles the first

author of the thing.”
