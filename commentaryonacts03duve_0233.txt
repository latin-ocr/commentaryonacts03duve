to the Neocaesarean synod, who suffered martyrdom under Lici-
nius, as Eusebius writes in his Chronicle. Gregory N azianzen, in
his fortieth oration, which is upon holy baptism, treating of those
who die without baptism, gives us an instance in those to whom
baptism was not administered, by reason of infancy. And the self-
same Nazianzen, though he was a bishop's son, being a long time
bred up under his father's care, was not baptized, till he came to
man’s age, as he doth teach us in his life. In like manner Basil
the Great, that was born of very devout parents, and instructed
unto godliness from his childhood, was not baptized until he was a.
man, if any credit be to be given to his life, that goes about under
the name of Amphilochius. John of Antioch, called afterward
Chrysostom, was born of Christian parents, as the truer opinion
is, tutored by the famous Bishop Meletius, was yet not baptized
till he was one and twenty years of age. Hierom also, Ambrose‚
and Austin‚ who were born of Christian parents, and consecrated
to Christian discipline, even from their childhood, were not
baptized before they were thirty years of age. Hence it doth
manifestly appear, ‘⁶ That the wisest of our fathers in Christ did
not come unto baptism until they were come to a strong and
confirmed wit and age ;” as Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down,
observeth in the l2th sect. of the Life of Christ, in the sermon on
Repentance, n. 20. Tertullian, in his book of baptism, ch. xviii.
gives advice to infants to come unto Christ to be instructed, not
to be baptized before they have understood the force of baptism.
“ Therefore,” says he, “ for the condition, and disposition, also age
of every person, the delaying of baptism is more profitable: yet
chiefly about little ones. What need is there of sureties to be
brought in danger, who even themselves may break their promises
through mortality, and be deceived by the increase of an evil
disposition? Indeed the Lord saith, Do not pse hinder them to come
unco me. Let them come, therefore, while they grow to years,
let them come while they learn, and while they corne let them be
taught. Let them become Christians, when they are enabled to
know Christ. thy doth innocent age hasten to the remission of
sins? Men will deal more warily in worldly affairs, so that they
who are not trusted with an earthly inheritance, are trusted with
a heavenly: let them know to ask for salvation, that thou mayest
appear to have given it to him that desircth.” Ludovicus Vives
