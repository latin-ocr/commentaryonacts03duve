was it contiguous to Palestine, as Adrichomius will have it in
the theatre of the Holy Land, which, as being in Mesopotamia,
is rather contiguous to Arabia the Desert, as this is extended north-
ward to Euphrates, wherein we have placed J ob’s habitation3 yea,
those of the east do declare that Charran in Abraham’s days was
inhabited by the Sabaean Arabiane, as also the famous Hottinger
in his Oriental History, chap. viii., out of Kesseus the Muham-

superstition and idol-worship of the Chaldaeans, or as those of the

words sufficiently importeth, that he speaketh of one call, when
Abraham dwelt at Ur of the Chaldees, where he was born and

Canaan? Tol-niellus answers, in the year of the world 2113,

settle there, or go further to some more remote country, and there-

to pass over towards the land of Canaan, firmly believing that
there the Lord would show him the land whereto he must go,
and in which he must abide3 even as a little after it truly came
to pass. For when he came to Sichem in the land of Canaan,
he heard from God, Gen. xii. 7: To thy seed will I {sive tlze
