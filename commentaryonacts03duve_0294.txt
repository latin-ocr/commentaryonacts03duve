16. They were astonished. That is, they were struck with an
unlooked for joy.

17. But he beekom‘ny mato them with lzz‘s leand to leold their peace.

That is, desiring silence by the beckoning of his hand, as after-
! wards, ch. xiii. 16 ; xix. 333 xxi. 40. Quintilian speaking of the
hands, saith, “They are either held up or down, according as we
consent or deny.’⁷

How the Lord had brouylzt him out. Peter does not give the
honour of his deliverance out of Herod's prison to the angel, but
to the Lord of angels, who made use of the angel in it.

Tell με to James. An eminent servant of God, and of the Lord
J esus Christ, peculiarly selected, together with John and me, to
preach the gospel to the Jews, Gal. ii. 9, and who, some believe,
governed then the church at Jerusalem.

And to the bretlzren. That is, and to the rest of them who live
in the striet brotherly fellowship of Christ's disciples. So also in
other places, by brethren are meant Christians, as before, ch. ii. 303
x. 233 xi. l, 123 J ames i. 2, 9, 816. But Peter would have this

journeys came to Rome. But Lactantius 11115 recorded in his

⁴ golden book of the Deaths of the Persecutors, that Peter came

not to Rome till the reign of Nero, twenty-five years after Christ’s
ascension into heaven. Moreover Damascus, to whom is ascribed
the Book of the Popes inserted in the first tome of 1116 Councils,
says that Peter came to Rome in Nero’s time. Therefore what
Petavius writes:l “The acts of the rest of the apostles (besides
Peter and Paul) not being treated of with any faithfulness or
credit worthy of a history, remain in obscurity.'' This also may
deservedly be said of both Peter’s bishoprics of Antioch and Rome,
of this being extended to twenty-five years, of Peter’s acts at
Rome, of the popedom there erected, of his eontention with Simon
Magus, which began there, and of a successor appointed by him.

Amonyst tloe soldiers. That is, those who guarded Peter.
