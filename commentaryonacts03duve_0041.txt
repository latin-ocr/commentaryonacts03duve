and dining-rooms served not only for the keepers and ministers of
the temple, the priests and Levites, and for the preservation of the
holy things, but also for the assembling of devout people to attend
to religious exercises. Hence it was that Baruch read the book of
J eremiah in the chamber of Gemariah. In such a chamber it is
probable that the devdut women met, and were defiled by the sons
of Eli, who are said to have had their lodgings at the door of the
tabernacle, 1 Sam. ii. 22. Some such place had Anna the pro-
phetess to stay in, wlzo departed not from tlte temple, but ser-ved
God with fastirzqs and prayers m'fslzt ancl day, Luke ii. 37. N or is
it to be questioned but that the apostles chose to themselves such
a place, while they are said to have been continually in the temple
praisz'ny and blessiny God, Luke xxiv. 53. St. Luke describes
the place, that is to say, that it was an ‘upper room where they
remained together, and continued with one accord in prayer and
supplicatim, Acts i. 13. And this adds much to the lustre of that
illustrious descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles, whereof
in the following chapter, if we agree it to have fallen out in the
temple, where formerly the majestical shadow of God inhabited,
but was withdrawn ever since the Babylonish captivity and the
loss of the ark3 to the end that laying aside that allegorical type
of God’s presence, they might aspire to the enjoyment of that real
presence which God was shortly to iinpart to thern, in that very
place where his presence was only figuratively represented before ;
and as the cloud is said to have filled the house, by Solomon
dedicated and consecrated, 1 Kings viii. 103 so the wind of the
Holy Ghost filled the same house, Acts ii, 2, not that from thence-
,forward they should remain fixed to that house, but that being
driven by the same wind, they might fill the whole world with the
gales of evangelie grace3 and thus the law went truly out of
Sion. Wherefore Erasmus¹ places this upper room in Mount
Sion. For comparing this place with that where the law was
given of old, “in both,” saith he, “there is height of place ; but
in this there is nothing but a mountain, which the people also are
forbid to approach, that is, the dull and earthly, not capable of
spiritual things 3 here there is a house upon the mountain itself, to
let thee understand the concord of the church. There was Mount
Sinai proper for the promulgation of the law, which by the multi-
tude of its precepts curbs a rebellious people3 for it is called Sinai
