Come over into Macedonia, and help us. To wit, by the preaching
of the gospel of salvation. Macedonia, one of the largest regions
in Europe, is bounded upon the east with the AEgean Sea, upon
the south by Thessaly and Epirus, upon the west by the Ionian
Sea, upon the north by Mount Scardus and Orbelus. It is said
to have taken its name from Macedo the son of Jupiter, begotten
by Thyia, Deucalion’s daughter. It was also called Ematia and
Macetia, whence its inhabitants are called Macetes, and if it be a
woman, Macetis. The most famous cities of Macedonia were,
Thessalonica for its bigness, Ege for the sepulchres of its kings,
and Pella for Alexander’s birth. The most famous of its rivers
was Strymon, of its mountains Athos, which, because it is situate
between Macedonia and Thrace, it is by some annexed to Thrace.

Philip, Alexander the Great's father 3 but it increased to such
greatness under Alexander himself, that he subdued Asia, Armenia,
Iberia, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, India, Phoenicia, Media, and
Persia, and at length all the east and India. At last it decayed
under Perseus the son of Philip, who being overcome by Paulus
AEmilius the consul, lost his kingly dignity, together with his
kingdon13 such a difference of fortune these two men showed,
both Philip's sons—the one, like lightning, conquered all those
nations, but the other lost the kingdom itself, and was carried
captive, with his wife and children, to Rome by AEmilius, and
since, Macedonia was reduced to the form of a prefecture, as Pliny
relatcs.¹

following, it appears that Luke, who wrote those Acts of the
Apostles, did attend Paul as his companion from Troas, if not from
Antioch.
