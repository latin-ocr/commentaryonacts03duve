VER. xxxvun] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 59

whom first of all the second Synod of Ravenna approved the
abuse introduced into some churches about a hundred years before,
that baptism without any necessity should be administered by
aspersion. Hence it came to pass, that contrary to the analogy‚
or intended mystical signification of this sacrament, all the west
for the most part has in this age the use of rlzantzzsm, that is,
sprinkling, instead of baptism, as Zepper speaks, to the great
scandal of the Greeks and Russians, who to this day plunge into
the water those they baptize‚ and deny any one to be rightly
baptized who is not plunged into the water, according to the
precept of Christ, as we may find in Sylvester Sguropulus, and
Cassander} “ The custom of the ancient ehurch was not sprink-
ling, but immersion, in pursuance of the sense of the word
baptizing in the commandment, and of the example of our blessed
Saviour ;’' saith Dr. Jeremy Taylor.² “The Greek word baptez‘7z,’'
saith Salmasius in the notes of divers upon Sulpitius Severus,³
“from which the word baptizem is derived, signifies immersion,
not sprinkling. Nor did the ancients otherwise baptize than by
single or treble immersion. In the Greek church at this day, the
person to be baptized is plunged over head and ears.’' The same
thing does Peter Avitabile testify of the Asian Christians inha-
biting Iberia and Colchi. ‘⁶ Only they who are bed-ridden,” saith
Salmasius, “because they lie down, were baptized as convenience
would permit, not as they who plunge their heads under water,
but by pouring the water upon their whole bodies. Thus N ovatus
was baptized in his sickness by effusion all over, not by im-
mersion3’4 Gregory N azianzen relates many and various names
of this sacrament,⁵ among which are these two, baptism and
washing. And adding the reason for these appellations, “it was
called,” says he, “xvashing, because thereby sin is washed away3
and baptism, in regard that sin is thereby signified to be buried.’'
For, as saith St. Ambrose,6 “Water is that wherein the body is
plunged, to wash all sin away. There all vice is buried.’' Which,
in the book inscribed, “ Reformation of the Ecclesiastical Laws,”
printed at London, 1641, is expressed in these words, “ While we
are plunged in the water, the death and burial of Christ is recom-
mended to us, that we openly testify that sin lies dead and buried
