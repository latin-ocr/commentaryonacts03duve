time be preached by Paul and Timothy in the proconsular Asia,
whose metropolis was Ephesus, are hid from us. He might have
had many, either that 110 would make use of their ministry some
where else, or that he had appointed some other 10 that work.
Whatcver it is, certainly the reason is not to be brought from God’s
absolute decree of reprobation, as Calvin upon this place doth3 for
it is certain that the gospel was at least soon after preached in this
place, and that by Paul himself, so that Demetrius the silver-smith
did greatly larnent the admirable progress of the gospel in Asia
by Paul's ministry, saying, 011. xix. 26: Ye see ancl hear that not κ
alone at Ephesus, but almost clm-ozaylaout all Asia, this Paul laath per-
suaded and turned away much people, saying] that they be no yods
wlzz'elz are made with hands. “

7. After they were come to lllysia. Mysia is a region of Asia the
lesser, upon 1110 Hellespont, bordering upon Troas3 whose inhabi-
tants were called Mysi and Mysii, and in the AEolic dialect Mysadii,
saith Stephanus. These Mysians were men of a base temper, so
that they made the place become a proverb, for when they spake of
a man of no worth, they called him ‘last of 1110 Mysians3’ and
because he who once comes to be contemned is exposed to the
rapine and injury of others, therefore from that nation flowed
another proverb, ‘⁶ The prey of the Mysians.'’ This second Aristotle¹
made use of, as Cicero did of the first proverb in his oration for
Lucius Flaccus: ‘⁶ For,” saith 110, “ Α5 Ι suppose your Asia consists
of Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, Lybia3 whether then 15 11115 proverb,
ours 01 yours, ⁶ A Phrygian is made better by stripes ‘?' for is not
this your common saying of all Caria, if you were 10 do anything
with hazard, ‘ That it should be chiefly done in CarIa? For what
15 111010 common and famous among the Greeks, than if a man be
brought to despite, to say, ‘He is the last of the Mysians? '’ Strabo
places also a people called the Mysians in Europe, at the confines
of Pannonia upon the river Danube, and thinketh that theuMysians
in Asia took both their name and original from them3 but these
in Europe are by Pliny called Moesi. Mysia is divided into 1110
105501, or Hellespontio, lying towards the Hellespont, and hath
Troas upon the south ; and the greater, which is called ad Olym-
pum, or Olympenica, where live the people called Olympeni. It is
bordercd upon the west with Mysia the lesser and Troas, upon the
east with Bithynia, upon the south with Asia Proconsular, or Asia
properly so called. Ptolemy makes also 1110 European Mysia
