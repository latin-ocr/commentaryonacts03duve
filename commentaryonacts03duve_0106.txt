Now, since there is no place in the law that more manifest-‚ly points
at Christ, I believe that Christ refers to it, when he says, lVleo
believes in me, as the scripture has said, John vii. 38. This, the
Father, with a heavenly voice, declared openly of Christ, and
commanded all to hear him, Matt. xvii. 5. Admirably, therefore,
Grotius upon that place of Matthew: “ Those things which follow
in Moses are to be observed, as if it had been said, You have
yourselves desired of God not to act among you by signs of
terror; God consents to your petition3 and therefore the Word is
made fiesh. He made himself of 720 reputation, and took upon him
the form of α servant. Behold him who, while he excels Elias in
vehement zeal toward the house of God, at the same time exceeds
Moses in meekness. N either thunders, nor clouds, nor fires from
heaven bear witness of him3 but the cheering light and affable
voice of the Father.'’

who is confessed and manifestly appears to be recommended by
Moses as the ehieftain of all the prophets, Deut. xviii. 15, 19.

Slzall be destroyed from amony the people. He does not deserve
to be numbered among the people of God who refuses Christ for
his master, by whom alone God instruets us 3 so that he cuts him-

head of it. And, indeed, eternal destruction is prepared for all
those that will not obey Christ, as the apostle witnesses, 2 Thess.

of the prophets after h‘Ioses, in a long succession of time from
Samuel who led their sacred chorus; therefore the Jerusalem Tal-

or “ declared bef01·e.”

Oftlzose days, WVherein God has chosen to procure the salva—
tion of his people by the Christ whom we preach. But how or
in what manner Samuel nominally foretold of Christ, does not
appear in scripture, unless we refer hither what we read about the
anointment of David, who* was to be a type of the future Mes-
siah when he was elected king of the Israelites by the divine
choice of God, 1 Sam. xvi. 8, 13. But frequently the prophete that
lived after Samuel among the Israelites prophesy concerning Christ.
