that the Israelites made and worshipped a calf, and that Moses
bruised the calf, but no where is it to be read the head of a
calf. Yet there is no reason why any should imagine that this
idol, according to the opinion of the ancients, had the head only
of a calf, the rest of it resembling a man, such as was Βουκέρων,
the feminine representation of Isis in Herodotus. For a head
of an ox, or calf, signifies nothing else but an ox, or a calf.⁷’
So Iliad, Ψ ver. 260, in the plays at Patroclus’s funeral, “Achilles,
for rewards to the gamesters, caused to be brought out of the
ships, horses and mules, and the strong heads of oxen,'' that is, peri-
phrastically, oxen, as the scholiast observes there. Again, in the
hymn on Mercury, Apollo’s oxen, taken from him by craft, are
. thrice called strong heads of oxen. Which Virgil, AEneid. v. 61,
62, imitates thus:

Aleestes, of the Trojan offspring gives,

Of's lmuuty, every ship two heads of beeves 3
two heads of beeves, that is, two oxen.'' Thus far the universally ’
learned Samuel Bochart.

itself a greater absurdity, seeing they cannot be gods that are
made by men3 nor could iinages be said to go before them, which
have feet and walk not3 yet there is no need of thinking that
monster of polytheism to be insinuated by this expressi0113 for the
plural is used for the singular, as when the Israelites say of one
calf, Exod. xxxii. 43 These be thy θοῶς, Ο Israel, which have
brousshc thee out (gf the hand os Eyypt. So in the Hebrew original
Abraham, who acknowledged one only God, yet said, Gen. xx. 13:
The Gods made me wcmder from my father’s house. And, Gen.
xxxv. 7, Jacob called the plac-e Bethel, because the Gods were
there seen by him. And David, Ps. xlix. 2, Let Israel rcjoz'ce 7“71
his Malcers. And Solonion, Eccles. xii. 1, Refmember thy Creator-5.
The Philistines also, though they knew that they worshipped but
one God in Israel, yet when they were struck with his terrors, they
said, tho will ‹leliver us out of the hands of these mfiqhty Gods?
These are the Gods which smote the quspte'ans, 1 Sam. iv. 8. And
therefore ,Ionatham understood these things as spoken of one God.
So likewise Theodoret, Quest. 1, 011 l Kings. Nor is it to be
doubted, but the Israelites intended the same in these words,
These are thy yods, Ο Israel, which the following words plainly
shew, which brovtylzt thee out ⁰f the land qs Eyypt. By which words
