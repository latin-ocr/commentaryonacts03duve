nor his parents were guilty of any notorious sin, John ix, 3.
Wherefore prosperity nor adversity are not to be reekoned as the
measures of any man’s virtue or wickedness. But the judgment of
what is unrevealed must be left to God alone, the great judge of all
men. Fourthly‚ they also sinned in their rash judgment of Paul,
without expecting the event. Whereupon they conclude him
utterly undone, with no less confidence than if they had seen his
death in the event. thence they say in the preterite tense, ‘Justice
or Dice has not suffered him to live3’ as by others it was said of
David, Psalm xli. 8, An evil disease eleavetlz fast anto him, and
now tlzat he lieth, lte slzall rz'se no more. Nevertheless David rose
out of his bed beyond their thoughts and expectation. Even so it
befell Paul at this time. For he died not of the viper's bite, which
the barbarians saw hang on his hand?⁷ “

Szfferetlz not him to live. Greek εἰἀσε, “sufferet ‚⁹² in the preterite.
See what we have but now observed. A certain man suffering
shipwreck, got safe to land in Libya3 where, sleeping on the shore,
he is said to have been killed by the biting of a viper. Of whom
Statilius Flaccus has a very eloquent poem, Antolog. lib. iii. cap.

2, to this purpose.
From raging sea one shipwreck’d ’scap'd to land,
And laid him down upon the Libyan saud,
Close by the shore dead sleep did him o'ertake,
Naked, and wearied aster his dire wreck 3
W⁷here he was killed by a deadly snake.
Why did he vainly with the waves contend ἓ
On land he meets with his deserv'd end.

An accident very like this happens to Paul. For a viper assails
him when he scarec had escaped from shipwreck into Malta, an
island near Libya3 but with a very different event. For this
encounter was no ways fatal to Paul, but to the viper, as im-
mediately follows,

5. And he shook off tlte beust into tltefire. f we will give credit
to OEcumenius, the viper of its own accord threw itself into the
fire, as punishing itself, for that it had set upon a body it ought
not to have meddled with. “It leapt,'’ saith he, “into the fire, as
acting revengc on itself, because it had invaded a body that did not
at all belong to it.'’ But Luke expressly affirms, that Paul shook
it off, and that into the fire that was near, not far off into the air,
as it is asserted in Prudentius's preface to book i. against Sym-

machus ε·-
lle shook a great way off the venemous snake z

It thus beat off, its way through the air did take.
