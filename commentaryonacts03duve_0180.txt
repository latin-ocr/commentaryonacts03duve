And lte was eoeceeslz‘nyfair. This Terence would have expressed,
“And he was of so beautiful a countenance that none exceeded
him,’' The Latin word, ῃναίῑιε, ἀστεῖος, saith Grotius, is from the
Greek in Exod. ii. 2, where it is in the Hebrew, nim, “beautiful.''
“ To God,'' which is added here in the original, is a Hebraism,

on Jonah i. 2, on these words, lee qreat city. Justin, out of
Trogus, lib. xxxvi. cap. 2, makes mention of the comeliness and
beauty of Moses. Of which Josephus thus, Ant. lib. ii. cap. 4, 5,
‘⁶ None was so indifferent: a spectator of beauty, who would not

admire the beauty of Moses, and many that met him when he was ,

carried in the streets were so taken with his beauty, that they not

laid it in the flags by the river sidc3 Miriam, or Mary, Moses'
sister standing afar off, and expecting the event of it. Being so
laid out he was found by Pharoah’s daughter, xx ho, as Josephus,
Ant. ii. 53 Epiphanius, in Panarium, and others say, was called
Thermutis. She delivered him to be nursed by Joohebed his
mother, who was brought to her for that purpose by the child’s
sister that stood by the river side, and adopted him for her son,
Exod. ii. 8. ‘⁶ And thus the hands of Pharoah’s daughter preserve
a revenger of her father's cruelty,” saith Augustine. Philo addeth,
“that Thermutis was Pharaoh’s only heiress, and that she had
been long married, aud because she had no children, she gave out
that she was with child, that it might be believed that she brought
