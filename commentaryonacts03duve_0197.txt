vna. nr] LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 177

Therefore the ancients attribute the first rise of drunkenness to
ihese feasts. And Aristotle ¹ saith, that μεθύειν, signifying “to be
drunk,'' was called so in the Greek, because, μετὰ τὸ θύειν, after
their sacrifices were performed they drank more liberally. To the
sanie purpose is that which Seleucus writes, that in the same place
feasts were called θοίναι, ὅτι διὰ θεοὺς οἰνοῦσθαι δεῖν ὑπελᾶμξαυου,
because they ‘⁶ thought it was their duty to drink largely for their
gods’ sakes3 '⁹ and θαλίαι, ὅτι θεῶν χάριν ἡλίζοντο, &c., because
‘⁶ they were congregated or came together for the sake of their gods.”
For otherwise, it was not of ancient custom to set before any, wine
or delicacies in any abundance, unless it were done for the gods.
To which that gradation of Epicharmus has respect, ‘⁶ After
sacrifice was feasting, after feasting tippling, which to me seems
very delightfuL from tippling proceeded frowardness, of froward-
ness came railing, of railing strife‚ from strife condemnation, whence
fetters, stocks‚ and fines.” WVhere the Israelites are said, aster they
had sacrificed, to have sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play,
the Rabbies by the word ‘⁶ play,'’ understand mostly these things.
For besides these indecent plays, the Tanchuma will have two
others to be designed in this place, to wit, whoring and shedding
of blood. The former he proves from Gen. xxxix. 14, 17, where
Potiphar’s wife accuseth Joseph, as if he had come 1712135: to play
with her, or to mock her, that is, to force her. The latter out of
2 Sam. ii. 14, where Abner saith to J oab, speaking of the twelve
Benjamites, who were joined with the like number of David's
soldiers, Let tlze young] men now mise, ἾΡΠῆ-ζ-ῬἹ, and play before us:
play, that is, let them fight and fall on to one another’s overthrow.
As if that most fierce engagement in which twelve pair of young
men destroyed one another, was looked on by the spectators only
as a play, as the cncounterings of fencers at Rome. Whenoe the
ancient Hebrews in Kimchi say, “Because the people made no
account of the blood of the young men, as if it had been a play,
therefore they were punished, and fell by the sword3 to wit, in that
battle which is mentioned, v. 17. But I see no reason why the
Israelites should be believed to have played thus after their worship-
ping of the calf, that is, to have fallen either into uncleanness, or
into murdering one another. I confess, that these have oftentimes
been the consequents of drunkenness3 but Ι find that the Israelites
did eat and drink, yet not to drunkenness. But, Deut. xxix. 5, 6,
