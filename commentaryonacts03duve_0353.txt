Theodorus Balsamon :¹ “ The sabbath days are by the holy fathers
almost in all things made equal to the Lord‘s days.'' Hence it
came to pass, that as on the Lord's days there was no fasting, as
being days of rejoicing, as the Gangrensian Synod teaches, Can.
xviii„ so neither on the sabbath days, except on one only, which
was that before Easter. In the Canons of the Apostles (as they
are called, which, though learned rnen know they deserve not that
title, yet they must be confessed to be ancient), the 65th Canon
runs thus: “ If any clerk shall be found fasting on the holy
Lord's day, or on the sabbath, except one only, which next pre-
cedes the paschal solemnity, on which Christ laid in the sepulchre,
let him be deposed (or degraded); but if he be a layman, let him
be withdrawn from (or exconimunicated.)” Ignatius, in an
Epistle to the Philippians, goes higher: ‘⁶ If any one shall fast
on the Lord's day, or on the sabbath day, save only on the sabbath
before Easter, he is a murderer of Chr-istst And to omit for
brevity the rest of the testin'ionies of antiquity, Tertullian, in his
4th book against Marcion, saith ε “ That the sabbath day from the
beginning of the world had this privilege, to be free from fasting.’'
Therefore when Justin Mau-tyr and Tertullian deny, that the
patriarchs before Moses did sabbatize, it is to be understood not of
their assembling together on that day, but of a strict rest during
all the day. Ignatius, in his Epistle to the Magnesians: ‘⁶ Let. us
not sabbatize after the manner of the Jews, enjoying idleness.
For he that works not, let him not eat3 and in the sweat of thy
brows thou shalt eat thy bread, say the sacred oracles. But let
every one of you sabbatize spiritually, applying yourselves with
joy to meditation on the law of God, rather than to indulge the
body with rest ς admiring the works of God, not eating or drinking
superfluously and walking prou'dly, or pleasing yourselves with
(lances and unreasonable frolics. And after the sabbath is over,
let every Christian keep holy the Lord's day.'' Origen, Hom. 23
on Numbers: ‘⁶ It is necessary that every holy and righteous inan
should also observe the feast of the sabbath. But what is that
feast, unless what the apostle saith, Heb. iv.‚ There remainetlz
therefore a sabbatz'sm, that is, a keeping of the sabbath, to the
people of God? Therefore leaving the Judaical observation of
the sabbath, let us see how a Christian ought to keep the same.
On the sabbath day nothing ought to be done of all worldly works.
Therefore, if thou dost forbear secular einploymentS, and dost
