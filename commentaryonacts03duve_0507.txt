14. But Ι confess, &c. As much as to say, But I acknowledge
and profess that Ι follow that way of worshiping God, which my
accusers brand with the name of the heresy or sect of the Naza-
rites or Nazarenes. Epiphanius, Hzer. xxix.: ‘⁶ All the Christians
were then called Nazarenes. But it came to pass, that for a little
time the disciples were called Jessei, before they began to be
called Christians at Antioch.⁷' Aurelius Prudentius Clemens
(περὶ Στεφαυ.>, in his fifth hymn, introduceth Dacian thus aceost-
ing the Christians :—

You Nazarenes be ready bent,
Your clunish rigidness relent3

Ye Deities the priuce invokes,
A ppease with offerings and smokes.

sect. Greek, “ way ;” that is, the religion, or manner of divine
worship.

So Ῑ worship my Fatlzer and God.1 In the Greek it is, as also
the English translation, so worship I tlte God of my fathers. That
is, I (levoutly and holily worship God, whom our fathers, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and the rest from whom I derive my original, the

Which Moses, and the prophets that came after him, have scaled
with their writings. See below, chap. xxvi. 22. Paul doth not
challenge them to some uncertain traditions proposed only by word
of mouth, and delivered down to posterity by the hands of men not
to be confided in, but layeth the holy scripture, as a sure rule, for
the foundation of his faith. Athanasius, in his treatisc of the synod
of Ariminum and Seleucia, saith, ‘⁶ In vain, running up and down,
:lo they pretend that synods were called together for the faith:
for the holy scripture is more sufficient than they are all.” The
same Athanasius against the Gentiles: “ The holy and divinely
inspired scriptures are indeed sufficient for the declaration of the
truth.’' The same father in the same place: ‘⁶ If ye will speak
other things than these that are written, why do ye contend with
us, who will not endure either to hear or speak any things save
those things that are written?” Eusebius Pamphilius to a phi-
losopher in the Acts of the Council of Nice, part ii. cap. 19.:
