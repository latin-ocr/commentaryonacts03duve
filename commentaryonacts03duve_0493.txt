doubtless‚ is the truest. For they who affirmed God himself to be
corporeal, as Nicolaus writeth, and Theophylact,¹ possibly they did
not so much as know God, being too gross, and therefore by con-
sequence must altogether deny a spiritual creature.’' Theodore
Beza observes that there are some among the Jews who are not
ashamed to say that angels are natural causes, performing the [will
of God, or producing good or evil effects.

But the Pharisees confess both. Viz., That there is to be a resur-
rection of the dead, and that angels, and the soul of man, or a
spiritual substance, subsist separate from the body. Because
angels, which are a species of spirit or incorporeal substance, and
the soul of man, are comprehended under the same genuS, whoso-
ever grants the existence of angels, seems, by the same confession, to
acknowledge that of souls, or of a substance separated from the body.

9. There arose, διο. There being a great outery among the
enraged multitude, the rabbins, or doctors and interpreters of the
law, who maintained the opinion of the Pharisees, rising up from
their seats, out of a hatred to their opposite sect the Sadduoees,
vindicated Paul's integrity and innocence to the utmost of their
power.

Certatim qf the Pharisees. In the Greek it is, ‘⁶ Those of the
scribes that were of the side of the Pharisees.'’ For there were
other scribes and doctors of the law who had espoused the tenets
of the Sadducees.

Strove. That is, contended against the Pharisees.

We find no evil in this man. To wit, Paul, who was brought
before their judgment.

If a spirit. That is, some incorporeal substance3 or, as Theo-
phylact will have it, the Holy Spirit.

Hatlz spoken to lzz'm. That is to say, Hath revealed something
to him about the resurrection.

Or an anyel. In the Greek is added, as also in the English
translation, Let us not flylzt ayainst God, viz„ by despising an angel
speaking in his name, things agreeable to the holy scriptures.
“ Here,'' saith Beza, “the word (τηρεῖ, as more familiar, seems to
be added to explain the word spirit.’'

10. Α yreat dissension. That is, a most fierce contentiori
betwixt the Pharisees and Sadducees tonching Paul’s innocence.

The chief captain, feariny lest Paul should have been pulled in
pieces by them. Chiding and scolding one with another.
