seventy-five souls, as coming also with the rest to Joseph. For
that number agreeth only to his kindred. Nor (1005 it militate
anything against what is said, that most are of opinion that the
ten sons of Benjamin, who are comprehended by 11110505 111 the
number of the fifty-two grandehildren of Jacob, Gen. xlvi. 21,
were at that time either none or few of them born, and therefore
they could not be rightly said to have been sent for by Joseph.
For it may be answered, that his sons, though born afterwards,
might be rightly added to the number, lest he only among all the
brethren should be reckoned without children. But there is no
necessity to recur to that, secing he was of that age then that he
might have had so many children. For Joseph was thirty years
of age when he was first brought before Pharaoh, Gen. xli. 46.
Betwixt which time and Jacob's entrance into Egypt intervened
seven years of plenty and two of famine, Gen. xlv. 6. Now
when J oseph was thirty-nine years of age, Benjamin might be of
the age of thirty-seven3 at which age, especially where polygamy
had obtained, why might not he be father of ten sons? Hence it
may be collected, that neither is there any error to be imputed to
Moses' text from Stephen’s words, nor to Stcphen's words from
Rioses' text, but that both spoke very well according to their
different intent. Hence it also follows, that the text of the
Seventy interpreters is corrupted, which, in Gen. xlvi. 27, instead
of seventy has seventy-five. Which seems certainly to have been
done by some Christians, who when they could not reconcile the
place of Stephen with the words of Moses, and did believe that
by all means Stephen was to be credited, they altered the Greek
text of Moses, or rather corrupted it, that it might be at least
demonstrated whence Stephen had these things. There are
manifest signs of corruption. For, first, all the Hebrew copies,
J osephus (Antiq. 4), and the ancient Latin interpreter, read only
seventy. Secondly, The Seventy interpreters themselves, Deut.
X. 32, where this story 15 repeated, do agree with the Hebrew,
and number only seventy. Thirdly, That they might varnish the
27th verse we have mentioned, with the more likeness of truth, '
they have corrupted also the 20th verse, where contrary to the
faith of all the Hebrew copies, the Samaritan, and ancient Latin,
they have added five others of Joseph's posterity, to wit, Machir
the son of Manasses by his concubine Syra, and Gilead, Machir’s
son, Manasses’ grandson3 as also Ephraim’s two sons, Shuthelah
