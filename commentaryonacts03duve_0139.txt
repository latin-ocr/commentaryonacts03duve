VER. XXXII] Ι LITERALLY EXPLAINED. 119

till we fully adhere 10 God, which will be at last, when we shall
have put off our flesh. It is indeed a beginning of repentance
when a man who first was averse from God, renouncing the world
and himself, begins a new life. But because (though once upon
the way) we are far from the mark, we must daily be advancing.
Both which we obtain by Christ. For even as he beginneth
repentance in us, so he gives us perseverance. This is indeed an
inestimable grace3 but it would profit little unless joined with
remission of sins. For Christ first found us enemies to God, and
the corruptions which make the dissension between him and us do
always stick to us, so that he might justly be displeased with us
rather than favourable to us. But justification consists in this, if
God impute not our sins to us. Therefore this latter grace ought
never to be separated from the former. Yea, the gospel will be
lame and corrupt, unless it consist of these two members: that is,
unless men be taught that they are reconciled to God by Christ,
by the free imputation of his righteousness, and by the new birth
of his Spirit transformed to newness of life. Thus we have, in

the same 3 for by words Peter understands things themselves, after
the Hebrew manner of speaking: 10 wit, those things of which he
briefly spake before, that is, whatever respecteth the dignity and
office of Christ, or man's salvation depending thereon.

And so is also tlte Holy Ghosz‘. As much as to say, Nor indeed
do we the apostles only witness these things, but also the Holy
Ghost himself, who is a witness beyond exception, to whom by
right ye are bound to assent, however ye refuse to give credit to
us. The apostles alone for integrity and innocency of life were

’κ worth credit3 but lest the stubbornness of men might leave any

pretext to cloak their unbelief, God would add to this testimony
another greater, to wit, the testimony of his Spirit. This very
testimony of the Spirit is joined elsewhere with the testimony of
the apostles, ,John xv. 26, 273 Heb. ii. 3, 43 but we must not
think that the Holy Spirit did bear witness apart from the
