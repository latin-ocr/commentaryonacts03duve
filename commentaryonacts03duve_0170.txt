bondaqe, and oppress them, is not to be referred to the four hundred
yearS, as if they should keep them in bondage so many years 3 but
the four hundred years are to be referred to this, Thy seed shall be
α stra729er 2⁸72 a land that is not theirs ,· for that seed was a stranger,
whether in the land of Canaan, or that of Egypt, until they
received for their inheritance the land, according to God's promise,
which was aceomplished after that they were delivered out of
Egypt: so that a hyperbaton is here understood, and the order of

all the 90ch qs Egyypt I will execute judyment, that is, I will inflict
punishment upon all the gods of Egypt.

8. And he qaue him a testament. Greek, “ a covenant.'' As if he
had said, after he had made those excellent promises he commanded
Abraham and his posterity to be circumcised3 that the same cir-
cumcision might be as it were a seal of the covenant entered into
with Abraham and his natural seed. “ This,'’ saith Grotius,
‘⁶ makes for Stephen’s purpose, that the observance of circumcision
might not be believed to be the cause of the promises.’'

And so. To wit, after he was circumcised.

He beyat Isaoc. Not by the power of nature, but by virtue of
God‘s promise made to him, that Isaac, given on account of the
promise, might be an earnest and shadow of the grace that was to

The patriarchs. That is, the fathers of the twelve tribes of
Israel. See above, ch. ii. 27.

9. And the patriarchs moved with envy. Here Stephen briefly
hints at. the emulation of the patriarchs, from whom the Jews
