was the ssight of death caused by the water.’¹ ‘ To be baptized
and plunged, and so to return up, and rise out of the water, is a
symbol of the descent into hell, and return from thence.' 2 - ⁶ Bap-
tim is a pledge and representation of the 1·esurrection.'³ ⁶ Bap-
tism is an earnest of the resurrection.' 4 ‘ Immersion is a repre*
sentation of death and buriaL’ ⁵ Innumerable are the testimonies
which might be added3 but these I think sufficient to prove that
baptism is an image of the death and resurrection of Christ, (from
whence we acknowledge the mystery of our religion, his deity
and humanity, Rom. i. 4,) and of all the faithful, who are baptized
in his faith, from death in sin to newness of life, which, if they
lead in this world, they have a most assured hope that being
dead they shall hereafter rise to glory with Christ. Which things,
if they be so, I beseech you, what affinity is to be seen between a
burial and a washing, that Christian baptism should be thought to
draw its original from J ewish lotions and divings‘? For if it were
true that the end of our baptism were to signify a washing
or ablution, or if it were true that the Jews of old did admit
their children or proselytes into their church by the adminis-
tration of any diving, as it is asserted by many learned persons of
late days, I confess it might be a probable argument that our
baptism was fetched from the divings of the J ews But to prove
that our baptism is indeed an image of death and resurrection, not
of washing, enough has been said. But as to their argument who
would have our baptism to be derived from the J ewish lotions, as
there is nothing of certainty in it, so is it so far from being
grounded upon any authority of scripture, that there are hardly
any footsteps to be found thei-eof in the Old Testament. They
deduce the original of baptism from the Hebrew word 023, which
signifies “to wash,'’ or “ cleanse,'⁷ Exod. xix. 10. But the rabbins,
if Ι am not deceived, make use of the Hebrew word ὅτευ-ω, which
signifies immersion, thereby making it appear that they owe the
notion of that word to the Greeks, or rather to the Christiana
For what affinity is there between lotion and immersion? Besides
that, we find some to have been baptized in sand. But the thing
is so uncertain, that it cannot be said of the rabbins that there were
not several among them who differed very much about this
matter3 for, in the very text cited by the forementioned learned
