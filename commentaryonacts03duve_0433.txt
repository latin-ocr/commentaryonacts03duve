money is spoken of, as Matt. xxvii. 15, after the Jewish custorn,
denotes a shekel of silver, which was every way equal to the Athe-
nian stater, and valued at two shillings and sixpence of the now Eng-
lish money. Hence Eusebius ¹ transcribed that τριάχοντα στατῆρας,
which Matthew called τριάχοντα ἀργύρια, which are three pounds fif-
teen shillings sterling. But here ἀργύριον signifieth the Greek coin,
and is of the value of an Attic drachma, which was the fourth part
of a ‹Jewish shekel, and of the same value with the Roman penny,
and with sevenpence farthing of our English money. “For the

by drachmas, as the Jews did by shekels, and the Romans by
sestertios3 but Ephesus, whose those pieces of money were, was a
Greek city, a colony of the Athenians, as Strabo and Pausanius

thousand five hundred and sixtywtwo pounds ten shillings, English
money.

ii. 11 ; v. 53 vi. 203 vii. 343 Ephes. iv. 233 Phil. iii. 33 Col. ii. 5.
Yet it is not to be doubted, but Paul did take upon him this reso-
lution, by the instinct of the Holy Ghost, as himself witnesseth in
the like matter, below, ch. xx. 22, and as at length the thing itself
doth show, ch. xx. 1.

And Achaia. A region of Peloponnesus, whose metropolis
was Corinth, where also Paul taught the gospel long enough.
Achaia here is by some taken for the whole of Greece3 the an-
cient Romans called all Grecians by the name of Achaei and Achivi.
Also the proconsul of Achaia governed both Peloponnesus and
Greece.
