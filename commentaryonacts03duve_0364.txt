344 THE ACTS 01⁴¹ 'rma HOLY APOSTLES [CHAP. XV·

whoredom: therefore if any shall violate these commands of the
Lord and his apostles, let him be suspended from the communion
of the church, until he shall worthily have repented.”

These canons have I alleged under the name of Regino, because
he has not informed us from whence he collected them. Amongst
the canons of the British church, collected by Sir Henry Spelman,
the fifty-second canon made under Edgar, king of England, ΑΛ).
967, requires that no Christiane eat blood of any kind. Adam of
Bremen, in the fourth book of Eccles. Hist. Ca. 20, amongst
other errors of the Pagans wherewith Adalbert archbishop of
Bremen complained that the Christians of that place were infected,
even unto his days, reekons these: “That they licentiously did
use to eat things that died of themselves, 01· were strangled, and
also the blood, as well as the flesh of cattle that draw or bear
burdens, as mules, asses, and horsesst’ J ohannes Zonaras cites the
fathers of the beforementioned sixth council held in Trullo at
Constantinople, whose sixty-sevcnth canon we cited before, and
proves out of Genesis, that they followed the authority of the
divine scripture. Theodore Balsamon on the same canon saith:
“The Latius, without distinction, eat things strangled, and as I
hear, the people of Adrianople do use the blood of animals in cer-
tain dishes.” And 011 the sixty-third of those that are called the
apostles’ canons: “ As for those creatures which are taken by
hawking or hunting and are strangled, how they are eaten by some
(that is, how they dare eat them) I do not understand. Otto,
bishop of Bamberg, in the year 1124, as Conrad, abbot of Ursperg
witnesses, having converted the people of Pomerania, enjoined
them ‘⁶ not to eat any thing unclean, that is, nothing that died of
itself, 01· was strangled, or offered to an idol, nor yet the blood of
any animal.” And to this day among the Christians the Greeks do
refrain eating of blood, as it is certain from the testimony of Nilus
archbishop of Thessalonica, in his book of the primacy of the pope3
and of J eremy, the second of that name, patriarch of Constanti—
nople. The same thing we are assured of the Muscovites and
Russians by Sigismund baron of Heberstein3 of the Abyssines by
Damianus a Goes3 and of the Maronites inhabiting in Syria and
Egypt, by Edward Brerewood. From all which proofs which I
have here brought, it is evident, that there is no opinion at this day
disputed amongst Christians, which has been so constantly and uni·
versally believed as this, that we are still obliged to abstain from
blood. N either, indeed, do those other texts of scripture, which
