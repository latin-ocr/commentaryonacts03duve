VER. xxv.] mriffiALLY EXPLAINED. 465

of wood fastened in the ground, of the height of a cubit and a half,
that he that was to be scourged might lie bent upon it. For as
the Mishna expresses it, he was not beat standing or sitting, but
bowed downwards, because it is written, the judqe shall cause him
to lie down, Dent. xxv. 2. And that the executioner might the
more conveniently beat him so ordered, a stone was set behind the
criminal, on which the minister of the synagogue stood. By reason
of this rite possibly, Luke used this word προέτειυευ, that the pre-
position πρὸ may denote, that Paul was so stretehed out that with
the upper part of his body he lay prone on the pillar. “The
Arabian,’' saith the now cited Lud. de Dieu, “seems to have had
respect to another ceremony, also in use among the Eastern natione,
with whom the criminal being prostrate was so stretched out, that
on both sides the officers did hold his head and feet, that he might
not evade or decline the stripes of him he was scourged by. Hence
he translateth it: ‘And when they had stretched him out between
the lictors,' some of whom, to wit, held the eriminal with cords
at the head, others by the feet. Nor does the Ethiopic much
recede from it 3 ‘and when having bound him they drew his
feet.’ '’

Paul said anto tlte centurion that stood by. Paul, bound with
eords, and stretched forth, straight ready to be scourged, repelled
the injury by lawful helps administered by God, saying to the cen-
turion whom the chief captain had left in charge with this torture
for the extorting a confession of the truth from Paul.

Is: That is, whether, as elsewhere frequently.

A man that is a Roman. That is, who has a right to the pri-
vilege of the Roman city. “ Tarsus, Paul's native city,'' saith
Grotius, “ was not a colony, but a free city, according to the testi-
mony of Pliny. Appianus saith this freedom was conferred by
Antonius. And Dion Chrysostomus, relateth several privileges that
Augustus bestowed on the city of Tarsus, but not the right of a
colony, or freehold, as belonged to Roman cities, nor does Ulpi-
anus mention Tarsus among the colonies of Cilicia. It remaineth,
therefore, that some of Paul's predecessore procured that privilege
to himself, in the civil wars, that happened betwixt Caesar Augustus
and Brutus and Cassius, or betwixt the same Caesar and An-
tony.”¹

Uncondemned. Greek, “unjudged.’' That is, without knowing
the cause. See above, ch. xvi. 36.
